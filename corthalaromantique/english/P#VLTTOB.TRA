@0    = ~(You see Valygar before you, the silent ranger. You remember the past you share with him...)~
@1    = ~Valygar is the man you love. He never confessed himself, but you know from all that happened between you that his feelings are just as intense.~
@2    = ~Valygar might have been a travel companion in the past, but he never interested you as a man, least of all as a lover.~
@3    = ~Cespenar, I am looking for a good present for my love, Valygar. Do you think you could find something special for him?~
@4    = ~Show me the presents you found for Valygar now, Cespenar.~
@5    = ~Hm... Cespenar looking for shiny ones himself? Hm, yes, doing that I can. Cespenar will go looking for shiny ones for your companion. Will let mistress know if he found something!~
@6    = ~Mistress! Mistress! Cespenar found shiny ones, shiny ones for your friend!~
@7    = ~For Valygar? Show me.~
@8    = ~Not now, Cespenar.~
@9    = ~Oh, oh, Cespenar will keep them safe then, until Mistress wants to sees them.~
@10   = ~First one is ancient katana, called the Dragon Wing. Only man of honor can wield... oh, maybe Cespenar was looking for wrong item? Friend of daughter of Bhaal might not be honorable man? He is? Hm... fine... Cespenar not judging! Only noting that time has changed... Oh well.~
@11   = ~Second one is Cespenar found out that sigil of House Corthala is Silver Hawk, see here? Mistress could make very personal present. Mistress could embroid something with Sigil! Very personal present, that would be!~
@12   = ~Third one is longbow. It's called... er, the Shiny One! No, er... Wind Singer! Can summon ally if battling... friend of mistress maybe fighting alone in forest, yes?~
@13   = ~Forth one is girdle. Girdle for protection. Mistress wants her friend to be protected, yes?~
@14   = ~Fifth one is ring. You wants to give ring, do you not?... But Cespenar does not have that ring. Cespenar has ring that protects loved one from bad spells. Very handy, for man with bad reputation amongst mages, no?~
@15   = ~Which one mistress wants to give to loved one?~
@16   = ~What were the choices again?~
@17   = ~I'll take the katana that can only be wielded by an honorable man.~
@18   = ~I will embroil a pair of pain gloves with the sigil of House Corthala.~
@19   = ~I'll take the longbow that can summon an ally in battle.~
@20   = ~I'll take the girdle enchanted with protection.~
@21   = ~I'll take the ring with protection against foul magic.~
@22   = ~Know what - on second thought - just leave it. I won't give a present to Valygar.~
@23   = ~Fine, fine! Mistress needs a little time, then? Ah, mistress is quick worker!~
@24   = ~Fine, fine!~
@25   = ~Time to gives present to lover, then! Cespenar will go elsewhere... Goes cleaning things, hm...~
@26   = ~Fine, fine. Cespenar takes away shiny ones again, then. Cespenar will go elsewhere... Goes cleaning things, hm...~
@27   = ~What is it, <CHARNAME>? I cannot recognize the expression on your face. Your smile is mischievous. Or is it shy? Or... What's happening?~
@28   = ~Valygar, if I were to tell you that I have something... something I wish to give you... what would you say?~
@29   = ~It's mischievous. I have been preparing this for ages: I asked Cespanar to find something especially for you, Valygar, and I cannot wait to see how you like it!~
@30   = ~I... I don't know... how to start... but I have a gift for you... Cespanar found it at my bidding. Would you like to see?~
@31   = ~That's no smile, ranger. That's the strong and valiant female's battle grin number 3! It usually appears on my face when I CHARGE!~
@32   = ~Oh, Nine Hells! The whole surprise spoiled! Must you have turned round right now?~
@33   = ~(shrug) It's nothing.~
@34   = ~Nothing? What is that package in your hand?~
@35   = ~I... I don't know... how to start...but I have a gift for you... Cespanar found it at my bidding. Would you like to see?~
@36   = ~No really, it's nothing. I sent Cespenar on a little extra mission but I think it was a mistake. Here, Cespenar, take it back, I don't need your "shiny one".~
@37   = ~Unless it is a letter in which you say that you do not love me, I will say that I want to see it.~
@38   = ~It is an ancient katana, called the Dragon Wing. Only a man of honor may wield it. I think that you are such a man.~
@39   = ~It is a pair of hunting gloves... Cespanar found out that House Corthala's sigil is the silver hawk and I embroidered it on the gloves.~
@40   = ~It is a longbow. Cespanar called it the Shiny One first, but I think that the Wind Singer is the real name. It is a powerful weapon and there is more... A man who wanders alone through the woods can summon an ally with it in the moment of need. I thought it might be useful for you.~
@41   = ~It is a girdle that will protect you when I cannot...~
@42   = ~It is a ring... no, not that kind of a ring, silly. Though Cespanar was babbling something about THAT kind as well, the nosy imp. It will protect you from the spells of the Cowlies and any other wizards.~
@43   = ~*Cespanar* found it for me? What... what is it?~
@44   = ~(smiles) Are you going to charge at me?~
@45   = ~Huh, nope, but I have a gift for you, and I was not sure how to start... Cespanar found it at my bidding. Would you like to see it?~
@46   = ~No, why? I'd rather give you something. I have been preparing this for ages. I ordered Cespanar to find something especially for you, Valygar, and I cannot wait to see how you like it!~
@47   = ~It is still a surprise, my light.~
@48   = ~Really? Will you turn away while I get it out of the wrapping?~
@49   = ~Ah, what's the difference! I have been preparing this for ages: I ordered Cespanar to find something especially for you, Valygar, and I cannot wait to see how you like it!~
@50   = ~I like looking at you, even when you are grumpy.~
@51   = ~<CHARNAME>, this katana is unique... it is perfectly balanced and its edge is sharper than anything I have seen. Did you say that it can only be wielded by an honorable man?~
@52   = ~I swear to you that I will not betray your faith in me.~
@53   = ~I do not know what to say. I am not proud of my family name, yet I am so deeply touched by your gift.~
@54   = ~Valygar, I love your name. Every letter of it. It is who you are. I wish... I wish you were more accepting of it. It would mean a lot to me.~
@55   = ~Your ancestors might have had many faults, but they lived, met, bred and produced you. For me, that absolves their sins. Maybe you shall see it the same way as I one day. It would mean a lot to me.~
@56   = ~I can pick out the stitches and embroider something else on it.~
@57   = ~The Wind Singer? Thank you, <CHARNAME>. It is magnificent!~
@58   = ~But do not worry overmuch about me wandering alone. I hope that I will always have one companion by my side: you.~
@59   = ~Thank you, my light. I recognize my own thoughts in this gift. I always wish there were more I could do to protect you.~
@60   = ~I am not looking. So, what is it?~
@61   = ~As ever you give me something to think about, <CHARNAME>. I believe, I understand what you are trying to say with this gift. That if I learn to accept my past and my family, then I will have no reason to die a loner.~
@62   = ~<CHARNAME>, thank you for your gift and I will think about it. I promise.~
@63   = ~No, do not do that. I... I like it. I believe, I understand what you are trying to say with this gift.~
@64   = ~That if I learn to accept my past and my family, then I will have no reason to die a loner.~
@65   = ~<CHARNAME>, I was thinking of our time in Suldanesselar. You were calm and dreamy there, and your smile was so gentle. I missed it in the turmoil of the last days.~
@66   = ~In Suldanesselar I believed that my plight was over, with the return of my soul. It's not, and it probably never will be. My soul is tainted. But sometimes, just for a moment, I dream of how the things were there...~
@67   = ~You missed it, ranger? Truly? I thought you were the sort who liked to live on the edge, bursting through doors, killing dragons and stealing a kiss from a comrade at arms amongst burning ruins.~
@68   = ~Calm and dreamy? Me? Valygar, if anyone is dreamy, it's you!~
@69   = ~I was not dreamy there! And I am not dreamy now! I was just... I was doing something extremely practical and down-to-earth! See this daisy? I plucked its petals one by one, and the last one told me that you love me.~
@70   = ~I dream of Suldanesselar as well... Every day I live in fear that an arrow will find you, magical fire might burn you, a sword could descend catching you off guard or of something else terrible could befall you. In Suldanesselar I walk with amidst the forest, forgetting about the sword sheathed across my back.~
@71   = ~(Smile sadly) In my company, I am afraid, you will not be able to forget about your sword for long...~
@72   = ~Suldanesselar is a distant dream now. But who knows, maybe one day we shall find another Suldanesselar, a place where one can love without fear... that is... if you want it to happen.~
@73   = ~Valygar, I was trying to guess if you loved me or not. Is it crazy? Or may be it is not? I do not know what to think, Valygar... Can love be amidst this pain, and destruction? The land bleeds. My duty is to fight to protect those who cannot protect themselves from my own siblings! Even if they blame me for their misfortune in the end! And I am loosing myself in revel!~
@74   = ~You miss the safety of Suldanesselar? I thought you were the sort who likes to live on the edge, bursting through doors, killing dragons and stealing a kiss from a comrade at arms amongst burning ruins.~
@75   = ~Guilty as charged. There is certain allure in it for me, yes. But it does not matter to me if I steal your kiss standing on the steaming maw of a dragon, beg for it among grand halls, or take it as a sudden gift under the boughs of an elven forest. The important thing would be that you would kissed me.~
@76   = ~Valygar, what you are saying... it leads me to believe that this daisy knows more of somber rangers than I do. I plucked its petals one by one and it says that you are in love with me.~
@77   = ~You are not about to tell me that you love me or some such nonsense, are you?~
@78   = ~I like the feeling, but I think I can do with less dragon maws and much more of forests and halls. I do not feel especially romantic when I have to support you while you would be kissing me, lest you collapse from grievous wounds. And I just hate to wake up after you have healed me and hear from the others that you were gazing at me with some sort of special tenderness... I always seem to miss it!~
@79   = ~Maybe I am. <CHARNAME>, I love you. Now that you know it, you can wake me up...~
@80   = ~Beloved woman, I needed to go to hell and back to realize that by denying my love for you I was fulfilling what I believe to be my curse - to bring sorrow to the one I love. I am wiser now.~
@81   = ~You... what?~
@82   = ~(You feel that deep crimson colors your cheeks) Valygar... I would not want you to wake up.~
@83   = ~I do not return your feelings, no matter how deeply touched I am by your words. If there is anything I can do to ease your mind, my friend, you need only tell me.~
@84   = ~If you want to know my heart, why not ask me? (Valygar gently cups your cheek with his palm and looks into your eyes.)~
@85   = ~I love you, my star. I love you more than life itself.~
@86   = ~Oh... it's such a surprise, Valygar! Why, I would never have guessed. That's why I needed the daisy.~
@87   = ~But it worked! Now I know that you love me, all thanks to the daisy. I am going to keep it until the rest of my days; which will be pretty close if we don't stop staring at each other and return to our quest at hand. I love you, too, by the way, did you know that?~
@88   = ~I love you too, my... my shabby, gloomy, grumpy, strong and silent friend.~
@89   = ~I am sorry my friend... I did not mean to tease you, but I feel it was better to talk it over sooner than latter. You see, I do not return your feelings. But I do love you... as a friend, as a sister may love a brother... or maybe even more than that... But I do not love you as deeply as you deserve to be loved by a woman. If there is anything I can do to ease your mind please tell me, my friend.~
@90   = ~(you close your eyes and whisper) Valygar... I love you.~
@91   = ~If I would kiss you, whether I am standing on a steaming maw of a dragon, or under the domes of grand halls, or in the depths of the elven forest tingling with mystery - you are my only thought.~
@92   = ~<CHARNAME>, I cannot lie to you. If you stay with me, you will know no safe haven. I am a man hunted and I am cursed. But...~
@93   = ~(Valygar gently cups your cheek with his palm and looks into your eyes.) I love you, my star. I love you more than life itself. I will protect you against anything, even against myself if necessary.~
@94   = ~Then I do not want safe haven. I love you, and I want to be with you, Valygar, no matter what. I am not bad at living dangerously.~
@95   = ~You do not need to protect me against yourself. I love you, Valygar and I think I will love you for the rest of my days; which will be pretty soon if we don't stop staring at each other, and return to our quest at hand.~
@96   = ~The land bleeds under the swords of your siblings, <CHARNAME>. We have a duty, you and I, and all those who serve goodness to stop it. Maybe I am failing my duty as your companion, and maybe I am picking the worst possible time to say this, but... I love you.~
@97   = ~(Valygar gently cups your cheek with his palm and looks into your eyes.) I love you more than life itself.~
@98   = ~I love you too, Valygar, and I think I will love you for the rest of my days; which will be pretty soon if we don't stop staring at each other and return to our quest at hand.~
@99   = ~Perhaps I should feel guilty, for being so happy amongst the misery my family has caused, but all I can feel is love. It feels so warm. I love you darling, I love you so much!~
@100  = ~I am sorry my friend... I did not mean to tease you, but I feel it was better to talk it over sooner than latter. You see, I do not return your feelings. But I do love you... as a friend, as a sister may love a brother... or maybe even more than that... But I do not love you as deeply as you deserve to be loved by a woman. If there is anything I can do to ease your mind please tell me, Valygar.~
@101  = ~I was going to tell you that I love you. If by falling in love with you I have failed my duty as your companion - please forgive me. I will not speak of it ever again.~
@102  = ~Beloved woman, I needed to go to hell and back to realize that by denying my love for you I was fulfilling what I believe to be my curse - to bring sorrow to the one I love. I am wiser now. Or was I fooling myself?~
@103  = ~How can I blame you for a crime I am guilty of myself? As you spoke it became so clear to me - I am head over heels in love with you. It's crazy, it's maddening, it's... wonderful!~
@104  = ~Perhaps I should feel guilty, for being so happy amongst all the misery my family has caused, but all I can feel is love. It feels so warm. I love you darling, I love you so much!~
@105  = ~I do not return your feelings, no matter how deeply touched I am by your words. If there is anything I can do to ease your mind...~
@106  = ~Please do not. I have no wish to be subjected to your lustful gazes ever again.~
@107  = ~I am sorry, <CHARNAME>. I am afraid, that it's how I doomed to live - on the run, with my sword in hand. I am hunted, and I am cursed. You will find no safe haven if you stay with me. But...~
@108  = ~I love you. Maybe I am failing my duty as your companion but... (Valygar gently cups your cheek with his palm and looks into your eyes.) I love you more than life itself.~
@109  = ~I do not return your feelings, no matter how deeply touched I am by your words. Is there anything I can do to ease your mind?...~
@110  = ~I have no wish to discuss the matter further.~
@111  = ~I cannot love you. Neither I can love anyone else. I am the daughter of Bhaal, Valygar, I can only hate.~
@112  = ~No, there is nothing you must do differently. We can part our ways, you can love whomever you chose, but you still will light my way.~
@113  = ~A surprise? I thought my feelings were quite obvious the night we spent together. Did it mean anything to you? Do you... love me?~
@114  = ~I am so silly! Yes, of course! Of course I love you!~
@115  = ~It was a mistake, really... I thought you would come to understand that yourself with time. But since you've dragged this skeleton out of the closet again; I must tell you that I have never loved you.~
@116  = ~We live in an uncertain time, Valygar. It prompts us to hurry to live, to race for new experiences, to snatch a bit of warmth and comfort wherever we can. Both you and I could die tomorrow. Why can't we just enjoy what happening between us, without asking too many questions?~
@117  = ~I love you... I truly do. My every instinct told me that night that you loved me, but I... I was still not sure. Sometimes it does not mean much to men.~
@118  = ~Now you know. It's up to you to give me hope with the three simple words, or to put an end to my feverish dreams. Do you love me, <CHARNAME>?~
@119  = ~Perhaps I should feel guilty, for being so happy amongst all the misery my family has caused, but all I can feel is love. It feels so warm. I love you, Valygar, I love you so much!~
@120  = ~I do not return your feelings, no matter how deeply touched I am by your words. Is there anything I can do to ease your mind...~
@121  = ~By the Nine Hells! By Mielikki's unicorn! What I am saying! I feel like a boy of sixteen years, <CHARNAME>, I am so happy. (Valygar catches you in his arms and swirls you around until you are both dizzy and breathless with laughter.)~
@122  = ~(Valygar kisses you gently and whispers in your ear) <CHARNAME>, before I met you I thought I knew love. I was mistaken, it has never been like this... so wonderful. My life belongs to you.~
@123  = ~You are right, we must get moving. But I want to say one more time that I love you.~
@124  = ~Do you not also feel invincible? The one who dares to love among hatred shall win out.~
@125  = ~I guess it is kind of stupid to stand on the stairs after the door was closed in your face. Forgive me if I get good and drunk tonight, will you?~
@126  = ~If you do not love me... so be it - I am a man grown and I can take it. I do not want half of your heart. I need the whole of it. Please, think on it, <CHARNAME> and if you do not feel about me the way I feel about you - say it and our liaison will be done and over with.~
@127  = ~<CHARNAME>, I deserved your mistrust. The Nine Hells. Yes, I have done my share of stupid and wild things. But I swear to you by the memory of my father, that every word that passed between us, every glance that we have exchanged, every kiss I took from your lips meant everything to me. The moment you walked into my cabin I knew there was something special about you.~
@128  = ~So that was the love at first sight then?~
@129  = ~Easy, Master Ranger. I trust you. Let yesterday to bury its dead. It's today that I care about, and today you love me.~
@130  = ~Ah, whatever. Life is too short to worry overmuch when the things are nice and good. If I am still on your arm forty years later, then you were right, and if not.. Well, all that happens, happens for the best in the best of all worlds. Let's go my friend, and do not torture yourself.~
@131  = ~Fast-talking is not going to work, Valygar. You would have kept me longer if you had enough brain to keep quiet. Now I am too disgusted to even look at you. Stay back, hide in shadows, do anything... but stay out of my sight and out of my mind!~
@132  = ~I doubt that there is any other kind of love <CHARNAME>.~
@133  = ~Thank you, my heart, for your trust.~
@134  = ~If you will stand by me for forty years that is. You are the last woman I love, <CHARNAME>, I know it.~
@135  = ~That can be easily arranged. The Nine Hells, you were not so easily disgusted that night, but I guess the things have changed since then.~
@136  = ~You know what fascinates me when I look at the brave adventuring ladies?~
@137  = ~No, and I have no interest in your opinion.~
@138  = ~I am eager to hear you out!~
@139  = ~Oh! Their grace, beauty, charm and...~
@140  = ~Hmm... Never mind then.~
@141  = ~We fight the same battles, we walk the same roads, yet the ladies' hair is always neatly braided. When and how they do it is beyond me.~
@142  = ~Ever heard of a haircut, Valygar?~
@143  = ~(smile) Is this a masqueraded plea for help? Come, sit down, I'll see what can be done with your unruly mane, ranger.~
@144  = ~Really? I have never noticed any particular difference in the variety and degree of hair messiness between the lords and ladies adventuring across Faerun.~
@145  = ~And modesty.~
@146  = ~Really, I only wanted to say that we fight the same battles, walk the same roads, yet the ladies' hair is always neatly braided. When and how they do it is beyond me. ~
@147  = ~Yes, and I so yearn for it.~
@148  = ~I think you should go with the Rashemi style. Or is it Minsc's style?  Anyway it looks both practical and appealing.~
@149  = ~I am not envious of the barber... it looks terrible now!~
@150  = ~It's not that bad. I like when men have this just-left-his-cave look about them. It's so... wild.~
@151  = ~You are going to re-braid my hair? Whom do you think I am, an effete elf? I'll just tie them all up with a leather band, but thank you for offering, <CHARNAME>.~
@152  = ~(laugh) No, you are no elf, but even a great wood-roaming beast like you can benefit from neatly done hair. Less time spent untangling yourself from the various flora and fauna, you know.~
@153  = ~I am effete then? At least I do not look like a... a barbarian scarecrow!~
@154  = ~I said - re-braid, not decorate with flowers, leaves, feathers and berries, ranger.~
@155  = ~Oh, now it looks *so much* better! Must you be so stubborn?~
@156  = ~I guess. Are demigods ever wrong?~
@157  = ~The female ones - never.~
@158  = ~(Smile) Does it matter? If you want I can try to do something about that unruly mane of yours.~
@159  = ~Valygar, let me tell you about a wondrous invention called haircut...~
@160  = ~And the big purple circle to go with it. Simple and tasteful.  I will follow your advice, <CHARNAME>. I just need to sharpen my dagger and find someone who will not cut off my ears during the styling process. (A sparkle in his eyes tells you that Valygar is teasing you)~
@161  = ~Good thing that I cannot see it.~
@162  = ~It certainly is wild. If you don't mind it's... well... it's good.~
@163  = ~You have a point, <CHARNAME>. I am at your disposal.~
@164  = ~(You braid Valygar's thick coarse hair into s a semblance of orderly arrangement).~
@165  = ~And what a couple we make! (Sighs) I am sorry. Your delicate beauty deserves to be accompanied by a man who does not look like a pair of herons nested atop of his head.~
@166  = ~(Laugh) I am glad that you see it that way. Let me help you with your hair, Valygar.~
@167  = ~I think I do have a couple of leaves and feathers there already, though not as decorations... Your delicate beauty deserves to be accompanied by a man who does not look like a pair of herons nested atop of his head.~
@168  = ~(laugh) I am glad that you see it that way. Let me help you with your hair, Valygar.~
@169  = ~Yes, dear.~
@170  = ~(laughs) I have heard rumors that such a thing exists... and I yearn for it.~
@171  = ~I am at your disposal.~
@172  = ~It is time now to set the gear down; to put away the weapons; to wash off the dirt and dust of the road. You look tired, <CHARNAME>. Let me at least take your boots off - I'm sure your feet will feel better.~
@173  = ~Oh! Valygar, you startled me. Maybe you should try to be less stealthy sometimes. I... I was remembering something.~
@174  = ~I'm not tired! In fact I can walk for leagues and I can fight for hours yet. The weakness of my companions is the only thing that stops me!~
@175  = ~Yes, Valygar... thank you.~
@176  = ~I would like to spend this evening in solitude, ranger.~
@177  = ~Would you rather not be disturbed then?~
@178  = ~No, no, don't go away. It's only a poem. I wanted to recite it to you, if you wish to hear.~
@179  = ~I would LOVE to be disturbed, preferably with a shower of kisses from you. ~
@180  = ~No, you do not disturb the train of my thoughts, for they were about you. I dreamt of the warmth of your hands and about the way you kiss. Butterflies fill my heart at this memory, and my lips tremble.~
@181  = ~Yes, I want to be alone with my thoughts.~
@182  = ~I forgot that your feet are tireless. And so small! My palm is larger than your foot is. In the army the officers drunk wine out of their ladies shoes, but if I'd use yours I am afraid I'd have to keep you barefoot for the whole night by my side, to get sufficiently drunk. Not that I mind.~
@183  = ~Mmgh... it's so relaxing... Maybe stopping for a time was not such a bad idea after all? Mmgh... Valygar, are you sizing my knee against your palm now?~
@184  = ~So here I stand before you, barefoot and with my hair down... what will you do, ranger?~
@185  = ~Please, stop stroking my knees. It puts me ill at ease. You are too... physical.~
@186  = ~Your foot is so small... my palm is larger than it is. In the army the officers drunk wine out of their ladies shoes, but if I'd use yours I am afraid I'd have to keep you barefoot for the whole night by my side, to get sufficiently drunk. Not that I mind.~
@187  = ~Goodnight then. Try to get some rest.~
@188  = ~Yes, of course. But would not you eat something first? ~
@189  = ~You are ever so kind to me, Valygar. Do not worry, my love. Sit here with me for a bit... Listen:
I'm tired of being a stray 
and a stranger on your way...
Don't glare, don't frown in anger
I'm loved and I'm to be yours
Not a goddess and not "m'lady"
Not a child raised by monks
It is me - in these wayworn dresses 
and the boots well-broken in - 
my embrace starts fires as ever
and the fear fills eyes still...~
@190  = ~Oh, now that you have mentioned it, I am starving! I guess I should return back to the campfire.~
@191  = ~Oh, now that you have mentioned it, I would like to have a bite to eat. I guess I should return back to the common room.~
@192  = ~Oh, now that you have mentioned it, I would like to have a bite to eat. I guess I should go rummage the packs.~
@193  = ~Ah, I do not know... I cannot think of anything else when you caress my knees like that. Are you... are you sizing my kneecap against your palm now?~
@194  = ~I will be glad to oblige, <CHARNAME>. Here is a kiss for your sweet lips, this one for your curious nose and those are for each one of your tender cheeks... And for your graceful neck... for your small palms... I'd kiss your knees, my light, but for that I must undress you.~
@195  = ~That would be most welcome, Valygar. And I will be sure to return the favor.~
@196  = ~Oh, Valygar, I am not sure if it's worth it.~
@197  = ~(Smile playfully and pull Valygar closer) Ranger, they say that men love like they fight. I want to see if that is true; after seeing you fight, my expectations are quite high.~
@198  = ~Daaarling... of course, you can! I dreamt of the moment when we at last be free to enjoy our love!~
@199  = ~The memory of your lips on mine is the sweetest memory I have, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps we can revive it now? Here is a kiss for your sweet lips, this one for your curious nose and those are for each one of your tender cheeks... And for your graceful neck... for your small palms... I'd kiss your knees, my light, but for that I must undress you.~
@200  = ~No, I am not sizing it. (Softly) I'd kiss your knees, my light, but for that I must undress you.~
@201  = ~There is a special kind of beauty about barefoot women. And you look like you have just stepped down from the clouds. (softly) I'd kiss your knees, my light, but for that I must undress you.~
@202  = ~I wished but for a moment of closeness, <CHARNAME>.~
@203  = ~I know, but I'd rather be alone now.~
@204  = ~You startled me, that's all. Kiss me, Valygar, I will not move away.~
@205  = ~My light, I dreamt about you becoming my lover; but if you find it inappropriate, please forgive me. You are so young and pure...~
@206  = ~I should have guessed that you have not been intimate with a man before.~
@207  = ~You are right. Even in my thoughts I have never imagined... (blush) anything beyond a kiss, Valygar. And I do feel... uncomfortable with... with the rest. It does not... does not change the way you feel about me?~
@208  = ~I have no experience in the matters of the heart, Valygar, but mine says to me now that you are the only man I want. I will entrust myself to your honor and your love.~
@209  = ~I loved a man before, but it does not matter any longer. I love you, Valygar. I am ready to accept your love and give you mine.~
@210  = ~Whether I am virginal or not makes no difference, Valygar. I understand that I do not love you. That's all.~
@211  = ~A man ripped the soul out of my body and took it for his own. An evil spirit of another man, a dead god, used what was left of me. And you call me pure and ask me if I am innocent?~
@212  = ~I have been close with a man before, Valygar. The memory of him is still with me. I love you, and I would not want you to share me with this ghost from my past.~
@213  = ~I am yours to the degree I can be. I need to be able to be rational and to make choices which will exclude you from my life if need be. I'm cruel with you, my friend, but I'll be crueler still if I allowed the bond which neither you, nor I could break.~
@214  = ~Your embrace kindles fires in my heart, yes. And... (Valygar leans closer to you) ...and you cannot imagine how grand is the fire which consumes me every time I kiss you. Let me kiss your sweet lips. This one is for your curious nose and those are for each one of your tender cheeks... And for your graceful neck... for your small palms.~
@215  = ~I'd kiss your knees, my light, but for that I must undress you.~
@216  = ~Do not go anywhere, love. I thought you might be hungry. Here, there's some flatbread, cheese, olives, dried meat... and some wine, if you want.~
@217  = ~(Valygar smiles as you eat and from time to time feeds you share a piece of food) That's quite a feast! Thank you dear, you are very considerate. You know what goes well with the red wine? A kiss. A long, deep, passionate... ~
@218  = ~(You eat in silence, giving Valygar a grateful glance from time to time) Here we are... you and me - alone and sharing a meal. No, Valygar, I cannot possibly eat another piece. Please, have some for yourself. You ever look so lean.~
@219  = ~I would rather get a hot meal... alone. I am sorry, my love, it's just I feel like being away even from you tonight. Goodnight, Valygar.~
@220  = ~Oh, that's awful! That's plainly saying: "Please spend the night with me"!~
@221  = ~Come closer then, my light. Let us forget of the world's battles and cruel gods for a few hours.~
@222  = ~What happened? Did I say something wrong?~
@223  = ~No, you did not, Valygar. I just... I am so tired... Can you hug me and talk of nothing important?~
@224  = ~Just leave me be!~
@225  = ~(laugh nervously) I am so contradictory... Love is a game, you know. Are you a gambler, Valygar?~
@226  = ~I will try not to disappoint you, then. Come closer; let me hold you.~
@227  = ~Come closer then, <CHARNAME>. We can talk... mmmgh... later. Much later.~
@228  = ~<CHARNAME>, I love you, and that will not change. I wish I knew though, if you love me whole-heartedly like a woman would or (if) you are a child playing the game of kisses, giggles and pretty words?~
@229  = ~I do not know myself, Valygar.~
@230  = ~Oh, but love is a game without rules, and sometimes one can win happiness at it. Are you a gambler, my dear?~
@231  = ~Didn't I tell you so already? Do you ever listen to me?!~
@232  = ~I love you with all my heart. After we are wed -~
@233  = ~Come closer then, my light. It will hurt you but -~
@234  = ~But it will be a sweet hurt.~
@235  = ~(Close his mouth with yours) No more words, Valygar.~
@236  = ~Well, thankfully you are not a boy. Two virgins teaching each other the art of seduction, lust and love is a dangerous undertaking.~
@237  = ~Then I will just have to ask Viconia how I can pay back. Later. Now I want you to deflower me.~
@238  = ~O, please. If it worries you so much you can heal it all back afterwards.~
@239  = ~Find yourself another fool to play with! I have had enough.~
@240  = ~(Valygar turns pale and his hand reaches for the hilt) Irenicus burns in the Nine Hells! If he had thousands lives, I would have taken them all for what was done to you. As for your so-called father - I have an account to settle with him, be he a god, a mortal, dead or alive!~
@241  = ~But you, my love, you are the purest creature I knew. Their filth did not change you. A swan raises from dark waters of the pond whiter than it was before, and the gold is cleaner after a furnace... my light... please, I cannot see you like this. I failed to defend you before, I know. If you can, forgive me.~
@242  = ~You never failed me, Valygar. Your loyalty is something I cherish. If anything can help me to leave my nightmares behind it's your love. Please, kiss me, my soul, and kiss me goodnight.~
@243  = ~I forgave you the moment you walked with me into the Nine Hells. There was that look about you... I knew then you would do anything for me-anything. ~
@244  = ~Oh, Valygar... please, sit with me and... I dunno... let us talk of nothing important... please...~
@245  = ~Go away! Please, just go away!~
@246  = ~You were drunk by another? But what of it? The tenderness I see in your eyes it is for me... is not it?~
@247  = ~Yes, it is for you... will you kiss me?~
@248  = ~No, Valygar, I am afraid it's not... what you seek... I am sorry. Please, leave.~
@249  = ~(Valygar walks away whistling a tune.)~
@250  = ~I have heard what you said, and I believe it now. Goodnight, my friend. (Valygar turns to go away)~
@251  = ~Wait... how about... about kissing me goodnight?~
@252  = ~(giggle nervously) Must you always be so serious? After all we are dealing with the matters of life and death every day! I am so tired... Can you just... hug me and... talk of nothing important?~
@253  = ~(Do nothing)~
@254  = ~I am not hungry... or rather I am, but in a different sort of way - my heart... I... am sitting here, by your feet and cannot chase away my desires. (Valygar strokes your knees) They are so small, your feet... my palm is larger than them. In the army the officers drunk wine out of their ladies shoes, but if I'd use yours I am afraid I'd have to keep you barefoot for the whole night by my side, to get sufficiently drunk. Not that I mind.~
@255  = ~Ah, Valygar, I can imagine doing far more pleasurable things in your company, than jumping about on one foot.~
@256  = ~And now you are sizing my kneecap as well as my foot? I am sure they are smaller than your palms.~
@257  = ~And that is something you don't want from me? Fine.~
@258  = ~Of course... (Valygar takes you into his arms) Well, I saw a white hart eight years ago. I had been hunting that day, but had found no prey worth note. I was traversing a meadow when it stepped out of the forest.~
@259  = ~Valygar, I have a small correction: "say nothing at all". The hug was good, really good though. Good night.~
@260  = ~You are the noblest and kindest man. I know that I can entrust myself to your honor and your love. I want more than a bedside story and a chaste embrace from you to<DAYNIGHT>. Please stay.~
@261  = ~Really? Wow!~
@262  = ~Yes. I put everything on one card and I do not know yet if I won or I lost. It is your turn now, <CHARNAME>. (Valygar turns to go away)~
@263  = ~Then there is nothing I can do but to wait for you to make up your mind.~
@264  = ~(Valygar drops his face into his palms and stays silent for a few moments. Finally he gets up and leaves with a dry: 'With your permission, <CHARNAME>.')~
@265  = ~I will sweeten it the best I can, <CHARNAME>.  I have been without a woman for a time, so I... (coughs) <CHARNAME>, I promise you that if I can't make your body sing with mine this first time, I will keep trying. I want your desire to be with me to match mine.~
@266  = ~(Valygar whispers apologies, his breath hot on your ear as he takes your maidenhead. He whispers passionate vows, kissing your belly and thighs afterwards. Next day his eyes are bright and circled by dark shadows, his lips are hot and dry. It is as if he feels guilty for his impatient and hungry loving, but cannot help himself.)~
@267  = ~(Valygar is only glad to obey your insistent mouth. He whispers apologies, his breath hot on your ear as he takes your maidenhead. He whispers passionate vows, kissing your belly and thighs afterwards. Next day his eyes are bright and circled by dark shadows, his lips are hot and dry. It is as if he feels guilty for his impatient and hungry loving, but cannot help himself.)~
@268  = ~I have been without a woman for a time, so I... (coughs) <CHARNAME>, I promise you that if I can't make your body sing with mine this first time, I will keep trying. I want your desire to be with me to match mine.~
@269  = ~This hurt is customary healed by making love again shortly after. Far it be form me to turn down the tried and true treatment. I have been without a woman for a time, so I... (coughs) <CHARNAME>, I promise you that if I can't make your body sing with mine this first time, I will keep trying. I want your desire to be with me to match mine.~
@270  = ~Of course... (Valygar kisses you gently) Goodnight.~
@271  = ~Valygar... my dear Valygar. I thought that a goodnight kiss was all I wanted but it is not true. I decided that I can entrust myself to your honor and your love. Please stay.~
@272  = ~Well... goodnight then.~
@273  = ~I will, my love.~
@274  = ~Then kiss me, and kiss me well, ranger. Kiss me as lovers do. ~
@275  = ~Valygar... I am sorry, my love, it's just I feel like being away even from you tonight. Goodnight, Valygar.~
@276  = ~(Smiles) Such as?~
@277  = ~Playing hide and seek? Hunting and gathering? Dual-wielding? Hmmm... I am running out of ideas here. What else are rangers good for?~
@278  = ~Making passionate love to you is the first thing that comes to my mind.~
@279  = ~If I put my hands about your neck - like that, and I kiss you deeply - just like that- will that clue you in? ~
@280  = ~Hmm... forget I mentioned it.~
@281  = ~My love, there is nothing I want more than you.~
@282  = ~Yes. It jumped straight at me... and all I could do was to throw some cherries at it. It ran away, and I thought that was an end to it. Imagine my surprise, when two years later I was crossing the same meadow and I saw a white hart walking towards me. I knew immediately that it was my old acquaintance ... for between his antlers grew a small cherry tree all covered with fruit.~
@283  = ~Valygar, I have heard this story before!~
@284  = ~Oh... now I am getting really sleepy. Goodnight, my dear deer hunter.~
@285  = ~I do not believe a word you are saying!~
@286  = ~(You touch Valygar's cheek) I was thinking, Valygar, how sad it is that you will not want to have kids. You definitely have a talent for bedside story telling.~
@287  = ~Let me see if I guessed what you wish, <CHARNAME>. Here is a kiss for your sweet lips, this one for your curious nose and those are for each one of your tender cheeks... And for your graceful neck... for your small palms... I'd kiss your knees, my light, but for that I must undress you.~
@288  = ~Ah, so you know it? You wanted a bedtime story, <CHARNAME>. Most of my stories would give nightmares to those far more hardened, more ruthless than you. My father told me this tale once, and he must have read it in a book. He could not have hit a 100-foot tall wall at two paces, let alone a running deer.~
@289  = ~My poor father... Well, goodnight, my dear love, sleep tight.~
@290  = ~Valygar, wait! I thought that a bedtime story was all I wanted but it is not true. I (lick your lips) I want more than that from you now. Please stay.~
@291  = ~(Laughs) I did not think you would. I had even harder time believing it once. My father told me this tale long ago. Even as a boy I knew that he could not have hit a 100-foot tall wall at two paces, let alone a running deer. My poor father... Well, goodnight, my dear love, sleep tight.~
@292  = ~You know, it was actually my father, who told me this story once. And I am retelling it to a woman I love instead of to a child of my own. (Kisses your fingers) It is sad in a way, but at least you are here to listen to it and unharmed by your closeness with Corthala.~
@293  = ~Well, goodnight, my dear love, sleep tight.~
@294  = ~Your closeness cannot hurt me, beloved. On the opposite, it is very pleasurable. And I want to be very, *very* close to you just now.~
@295  = ~Rangers are generally regarded as woodsman, good at guiding the travelers through the wilderness, but right now I can think only of finding the way for my lips to touch yours.~
@296  = ~Ah, that sounds amusing enough. Let us see, Ranger Corthala, if you would be able to accomplish the task.~
@297  = ~Hmm... how about the hide and seek? You go hide... and well... maybe just go.~
@298  = ~Really? I just dreamt myself of the warmth of your hands and about the way you kiss. Butterflies fill my heart at this memory and my lips tremble.~
@299  = ~Here comes the dawn to steal my happiness.~
@300  = ~One more kiss, <CHARNAME>, while the night lasts. One more kiss to remember you by.~
@301  = ~If only I could slow the passage of hours, if only I could hold you in my arms a while longer!~
@302  = ~We cannot let passion run our daily life. Here is your kiss, but in five minutes I expect you to be fully dressed, armor shining and ready for whatever battle is in store for us today.~
@303  = ~We cannot change the passage of hours, but I am not in a hurry to go slaughter someone. I am rather in a mood to stay where I am.~
@304  = ~There will be another night, Valygar. And I am looking forward to it.~
@305  = ~No, Valygar, no more kisses. It was a terrible mistake and I regret it now. What's done is done, but I do not love you, ranger.~
@306  = ~By the Nine Hells! Does your love melts away in the morning light, daughter of Bhaal? No! Do not say anything. Play your games with someone else.~
@307  = ~I'm ready when you are, dear <CHARNAME>.~
@308  = ~My feelings exactly, dear <CHARNAME>.~
@309  = ~I cannot stop thinking of Yaga-Sura's foster mother, <CHARNAME>. (Valygar frowns) She died a miserable creature, abandoned by the child she raised.~
@310  = ~Valygar, lots of people die lonely and forgotten by all. It is sad, of course...~
@311  = ~Is there something to your rumbling, or is it just a manifestation of your usual dark mood?~
@312  = ~Nyalee did not die. We killed her, Valygar. See the difference?~
@313  = ~(Shrug) Nyalee raised Yaga-Sura as a monster. She taught him how to remove his heart. What did she expect? That he will spend his life taking care of her?~
@314  = ~Bah, let all my vanquished enemies burn in the Nine Hells - along with your musings beside them.~
@315  = ~Sad? It chilled my heart, <CHARNAME>. I remembered what you have told me of your brother, Sarevok. There was a woman, you said, who loved him to the last; one whom he abandoned to her own fate.~
@316  = ~You caught a chill, ranger? How many times do I have to tell you to put on an extra sweater under that armor of yours?~
@317  = ~We do not know a tenth part of what had passed between Sarevok and Tamoko, Valygar. How can we presume to judge?~
@318  = ~He was insane then, and cherished power above all. Love has no place in the midst of the War of Sacrifice. But why are you interested in Sarevok so suddenly?~
@319  = ~I came to understand Sarevok well, Valygar. He gave his lover to the War of Sacrifice. Such blind loyalty to self-interest is commendable.~
@320  = ~Sarevok is not my brother, Valygar. We do not share even that shade of relation - Bhaal's spirit - any longer.~
@321  = ~As Yaga-Sura has abandoned his mother, we do not know if there was a soul in the world who cared of Illasera or Gromnir. I see... you are thinking that my blood will eventually make me put my cause above my heart.~
@322  = ~Sad? It chilled my heart, <CHARNAME> . (lowers his voice, so only you can hear) Take your brother, Sarevok, for example. There was a woman, you said, who loved him to the last; one whom he abandoned to her own fate.~
@323  = ~Sarevok is a dark man, Valygar. I understand his reasons but little. Whatever Tamoko was to him, her love was probably not enough to cower his lust for power. Or was there something else? I do not know.~
@324  = ~My brother has changed, Valygar. Whatever happened in his past, he is not responsible for it anymore, and the taint is gone from him. Whether he becomes better or worse for it, only time will tell.~
@325  = ~Dark events breed dark moods, <CHARNAME>. The ways of your kin are chilling. It is not only Yaga-Sura who has forsaken the loyalty of someone who loved him - another brother of yours, Sarevok, had done the same. There was a woman who loved him to the end, one whom he left, was there not?~
@326  = ~Dark events breed dark moods, <CHARNAME> . The ways of your kin are chilling.  (He lowers his voice so only you can hear) It is not only Yaga-Sura who has forsaken the loyalty of someone who loved him - another brother of yours, Sarevok, had done the same. There was a woman, who loved him to the end, one whom he left, was there not?~
@327  = ~Thank you for showing me the difference. I can hear it in your voice very well. Tell me, are you becoming as ruthless as the rest of your kin? Do you want to win your battles at any price? To sacrifice anyone for it? Like Yaga-Sura, or Sarevok? ~
@328  = ~I hate it when people talk about me as if I were absent. Another word out of you, Corthala, and I will twist your head off.~
@329  = ~What in the Nine Hells is that outburst about, Valygar?~
@330  = ~You know NOTHING, ranger - about Yaga-Sura, Sarevok, or myself.~
@331  = ~16) I will deal with it, Sarevok. Valygar, I think we need to talk privately.~
@332  = ~17) Sarevok is right, Valygar - you are becoming a nuisance. Speak another word - and I swear, I will gladly help him silence you.~
@333  = ~I can see why you are fretting. Do you think that it is in my blood to put my cause above those who love me? ~
@334  = ~Yaga-Sura has forsaken his mother's loyalty. So did your brother, Sarevok. There was a woman, you said, who loved him to the last; one whom he chased away from his side. It is a chilling thought.~
@335  = ~Yaga-Sura has forsaken his mother's loyalty.  (Lowers his voice, so only you can hear) So did your brother, Sarevok. There was a woman, you said, who loved him to the last; one whom he chased away from his side. It is a chilling thought.~
@336  = ~A good thing it is that we visit there so often. Are my musings the thing that you wish to condemn? Or is it me?~
@337  = ~No, you can live. Just take a vow of silence or something.~
@338  = ~20) Forgive me... I do not know what has come over me. Why were you talking about Yaga-Shura's mother?~
@339  = ~It's you. I hate you, Valygar. I hate that when you touch me, my mind melts. I hate that for your sake I start thinking of what the "right" thing is to do! I do not want you to be around to impede MY wishes. Leave me!~
@340  = ~Oh, dear. <CHARNAME>, I can withstand the local climate easily. I feel cold because... are you even listening to me?~
@341  = ~Of course! You are used to your moderate Amnish weather. Here you are likely to get influenza in no time. This cloak is way too thin, and although those boots may be magical, a pair of thick woolen socks will make them much *warmer* magical boots. Come, take it all off... Oh! What am I saying? (Close your mouth with your hand and giggle)~
@342  = ~I know what you are talking about, Valygar. You must mean that my blood will force me to put my cause above those who love me.~
@343  = ~I do not want to listen to you, Valygar. I am tired of it. I hate that for your sake I start thinking of what the "right" thing is to do! I do not want you to be around to impede MY wishes. Leave me!~
@344  = ~I do not intend to judge Sarevok or Yaga-Shura, <CHARNAME>, but I see a bad omen in their behavior... a bad omen for our love.~
@345  = ~That's just stupid! I am my own person. My siblings and I are not reflections; we do not follow the same path. I will not abandon someone I love for the sake of a cause, any cause... good or ill.~
@346  = ~Do you remember what I have done when the Cowled Wizards abducted Imoen? Do you remember what I have done every time someone has asked for my help?~
@347  = ~Valygar, you need to understand, that I am to fulfill a prophecy. The pull of destiny is strong. Sometimes I cannot control what happens. I love you, and I have no wish to break your life in two. My soul, we are not promised to each other or anything like that. If you are afraid... you... you are free. You can go... you can stay... and be my dear friend... as you were.~
@348  = ~Have you ever heard the saying: "Do not trouble the trouble before the trouble troubles you"? You did just that. When you spoke, I realized how much influence you have on me, and what a burden you have become. I gave you a high place in my heart and allowed you to impede my wishes, to goad me into doing the "right thing". And for what? For a kiss in the night? No more, Valygar. I wish to be free from you!~
@349  = ~I see a bad omen for our love in your siblings' behavior, <CHARNAME>.~
@350  = ~You are right; the other person's soul is a mystery. But do you know *your* soul? Will you follow in the footsteps of your siblings? I see a bad omen in their behavior... a bad omen for our love.~
@351  = ~That is a virtue for you? I did not realize it. You will be as ruthless in achieving your goals as your siblings. That is a bad omen for our love.~
@352  = ~Judging from what you told me of your brother, he had changed for the better already. Sarevok governs himself, now, that the taint is gone.~
@353  = ~I have no liking for Sarevok. Still, should we come to blows, I will consider him an honorable enemy now, and not a diseased beast which needs to be put down.~
@354  = ~I can see him becoming a man of honor and strength now, not a diseased beast that needs to be put down.~
@355  = ~But what of you? Those wiser than I sensed that the Bhaal's essence is strong in you. Will you follow in the footsteps of your siblings? I see a bad omen in their behavior... a bad omen for our love.~
@356  = ~Trust me, Valygar - I am who I am. I feel stronger than Bhaal now. I will not abandon someone I love for the sake of a cause, any cause... good or ill.~
@357  = ~Sarevok's tie to your Sire's heritage was broken, but he now has a portion of your soul. I see such a connection as stronger than that of blood relatives, though the relations between the Bhaalspawn are confusing. But I am not trying to chart your genealogical tree, <CHARNAME>. I will live with it into the sages of the later age. Neither am I berating you for your origin. I love for who you are, but... I see a bad omen in your sibling's behavior.~
@358  = ~Yes, that is what I thought. Please, call me a fool, and tell me that it is not so!~
@359  = ~You are right! I thought I knew you... but I was mistaken.~
@360  = ~Yes... it is a good idea to walk aside. I am sorry for being so outspoken... but the ways of your kin are chilling. It is not only Yaga-Sura who has forsaken the loyalty of someone who loved him. Another brother of yours, Sarevok, had done the same. There was a woman, who loved him to the end, one whom he left, was there not?~
@361  = ~Do not bother - it is done already.~
@362  = ~(Shrugs, and wanders away in silence )~
@363  = ~To the Abyss with you then! It is your place after all.~
@364  = ~Are you sure you are Bhaal's daughter, <CHARNAME>?~
@365  = ~Well, Gorion said so, and then Sarevok, and then Irenicus, and then the Solar... and then Melissan... pretty much everyone says that I am. So I gather I am. Do you think that I am not?~
@366  = ~In this world, one can be sure of nothing, Valygar.~
@367  = ~Who is Bhaal?~
@368  = ~It is impossible to talk to you when you are in this mood.~
@369  = ~My darling <CHARNAME>, it *was* stupid. I know how different you are from your siblings, but the living heart set on fire can upset even a man like me. I thought that I had seen every possible trick of the power-hungry lunatics. I was mistaken.~
@370  = ~You have always fulfilled your promises. I saw it... and still I doubted you. Forgive me, my star. But the living heart set on fire can upset even a man like me. I thought that I had seen every possible trick of the power-hungry lunatics, but I was mistaken.~
@371  = ~Who am I to stand in the way of the wise Alaundo words? Let us move on, <CHARNAME>, or you may be late for your destiny.~
@372  = ~(Quietly) Have your freedom then. I will dance with trouble during the masqueraded ball of death.~
@373  = ~I understood long ago that you are stronger than Bhaal, my love. It scared me before, but now I welcome it. Forgive me for questioning you, but the living heart set on fire can upset even a man like me. I thought that I had seen every possible trick of the power-hungry lunatics. I was mistaken.~
@374  = ~I can still see the fires of Saradush reflecting in your eyes. It was not your fault that the battle was lost. Everyone eventually comes to be beaten, no matter how great he or she is.~
@375  = ~The heavens are scarlet and they spill ashes upon us. It is all gone: the people whom I was trying to help, their houses, their everything! I grieve for them, Valygar, not for my defeat.~
@376  = ~I figure that I need a new hobby. Saving the world is plain hopeless.~
@377  = ~I have lost battles before, Valygar. In fact I lost the two most important battles in my life: when Gorion was killed and when Imoen was abducted.~
@378  = ~It should not have caught me by surprise... Alaundo foresaw Saradush:

"Armies march and cities burn 
The rivers froth with tainted blood 
The corpses of these born not innocent 
Feed the inferno of boiling hate..."

They keep telling me that my blood is tainted, and that I was not born innocent... how soon will a river run red with my blood, where a crowd will spit upon my corpse? (laugh hysterically)~
@379  = ~(sigh) I did not lose the battle: here is my enemy, defeated and dead by my feet. It is Saradush that has lost. Look how brightly it burns, Valygar! Look at the loser's fate!~
@380  = ~Then cry. Spill the tears for the common folk instead of their blood.~
@381  = ~The blood debt was paid, Valygar. I can afford tears now.~
@382  = ~Ilmater must laugh himself silly at the sight of a poor amateur such as I. (sob uncontrollably)~
@383  = ~I always thought that I had it in me to change the world... but I did not imagine that I would go about it by creating ponds of tears... all over the place...~
@384  = ~I lost a battle, not the war! There will be time enough to grieve and lick wounds after peace is restored. Now I shall fight, Valygar. Nobody can do both at the same time. Onward, comrades, onward!~
@385  = ~Saving the world - surely. But always doing your duty as best you can is what you can, against all chance of success and not expecting a reward, gives you hope, the strength to go on and the ability to survive the defeats.~
@386  = ~I am done with saving, great or small. I do not care any more. I just DO NOT CARE! (sob)~
@387  = ~Then I shall continue the fight, Valygar. Onward, comrades, onward!~
@388  = ~Bah! Those are only words. I do not believe pretty words any more. But I will not simply lie down and die. I bet that I will win in the end anyway.~
@389  = ~Yes, you know loss. But I can see how deeply this terrible wreckage affects you. Come... you need to get away from this nightmare, and the Nine Hells is not the right place. You will rest; I will hear no arguments.~
@390  = ~Prophecies speak in flowery and unclear language. This sounds like one of many descriptions of a doomsday, not your future foretold.  But... but you are not yourself!~
@391  = ~I am glad that it burns so brightly. I see your real face now, lit by the flames of the burning city that you vowed to save. All that I once loved about you is gone now.~
@392  = ~This was but one city destroyed by the War of the Five. I am afraid the blood debt owed by your siblings is much more than that.~
@393  = ~Stop it! I am not listening to you! Stop it!~
@394  = ~Then I shall fight, Valygar. There will be time enough to grieve and lick wounds after peace is restored. Nobody can do both at the same time. Onward, comrades, onward!~
@395  = ~I do not know what came over me. Why do I even care? It's just another city, another bunch of yelling commoners, and another pile of dead bodies. I have seen it before, and in all likelihood, I shall see it again. Let's get out of here.~
@396  = ~Shhhh... Come here, my light. Hey, you all, nothing to stare at!~
@397  = ~Come... you need to get away from this nightmare, and the Nine Hells is not the right place. You will rest; I will hear no arguments.~
@398  = ~You are always trying to cover your pain with a joke. You do not have to pretend with me.~
@399  = ~I am glad that you are not defeated.~
@400  = ~I am not one for flowery speeches myself, but there are some words worth dying for; honor, love, friendship. But you are not listening any longer. The Nine Hells!  I have become a fool who mutters to himself!~
@401  = ~(Valygar cradles you in his arms) Sleep now. I wish I could do more to ease your mind.~
@402  = ~Valygar, I appreciate what you have done for me... You make me strong, my heart. I can face this peril.~
@403  = ~It is a good idea to get away from the fires, blood and death for a moment, beloved.~
@404  = ~Actually, I was just thinking of one more way. I am restless, Valygar and in need of... soothing. In need of... consolation. (You place your hand on Valygar's thigh and stroke it lightly)~
@405  = ~The night is long, but it may be that we will live to see the new dawn. Rest now, my <CHARNAME>. There are many trials ahead.~
@406  = ~You act like a soldier whose blood is hot after the battle and plunder. This way leads to emptiness and I will not have you go there.~
@407  = ~(Nod and sob)~
@408  = ~I have not seen so many soldiers after a battle as you have, Valygar Corthala, but I seek love, not lust nor rape. The world seems to have so little love left... I need reassurance that it still exists, between you and me at least.~
@409  = ~Are you aware that you are not the only man alive or half-alive for that matter?~
@410  = ~Spoken from personal experience, I suppose?~
@411  = ~I love you. By all that is good and right, I love you, <CHARNAME>.~
@412  = ~I did not rape on the battlefield, no. Now sleep.~
@413  = ~I know that. I did not chain you to myself, did I? Go if you wish.~
@414  = ~I will go nowhere. An angry and thoughtless word, that was all.~
@415  = ~I will have you know that I am going to chat with my old friend Anomen now.~
@416  = ~You are so... artificial! All those stupid civilized rules! I am going to seek a company of someone more... natural. Cernd comes to mind.~
@417  = ~You know what? I am starting to think that I prefer the company of an EVIL WIZARD to yours. Now, I think I know where to find Edwin.~
@418  = ~I caught Haer'Dalis mooning after me a number of times. I am sure he will not treat the matter with such trepidation as you do!~
@419  = ~You know what? You are more annoying than JAN! In fact, the longer I think about Jan, the more it becomes apparent that he is not annoying at all! I am going to find Jan and maybe we can get something cooking, probably turnips.~
@420  = ~Are you an old man, and feeble to speak thus? Might be that an old man has more spark than you! I shall find out... besides, I always wondered if holiness rubs off when making love to a paladin. I hope that Keldorn will be able to provide me with an answer to this amusing question.~
@421  = ~Why have I wasted so much time on a rude woodsman, when there is a gentle and sensitive man like Kelsey around? This error can be easily corrected!~
@422  = ~Well, that was direct. Let me be just as forward: I think that I rather fancy the necromancer, Tsujatha. I hope he has a moment for me.~
@423  = ~Bah! There are times in life when a woman needs a dwarf. Strong. Simple. No-nonsense. I am off to find Korgan and offer him what you refuse to take, so long!~
@424  = ~The Nine Hells, Valygar!   People do not have to have to discuss the cause and effect of their action in all possible aspects to engage in play between the sheets! Will I ever find a man without brain? Wait, I actually do KNOW one! You can sulk all you want, and I am going to see if I can engage Minsc in something entertaining.~
@425  = ~I want a man with fire coursing through his veins, not water, Corthala. I believe that I know such a person. He was of the blood, so some memory of it must still live within him. I shall re-awaken it! My passion is for Sarevok tonight.~
@426  = ~If I wanted to bandy words, I would have spent a night with Solaufein. The man never goes anywhere without a book. I wonder if his fingers are as gentle on a woman's body as they are on the parchments and scrolls?~
@427  = ~A dead man is more alive than you! I will be more likely to get some satisfaction with Yoshimo than with you!~
@428  = ~I will go now, Valygar. I finally have a chance to complain about something to Aerie, and I do not want to miss it!~
@429  = ~I will go, Valygar. I really need to talk to another woman... to Nalia.~
@430  = ~I will go, Valygar. I will seek Mazzy out. She always has some sweets in her pack and she is ever ready to share them generously. And they say that Matzica's chocolate is as good as a man in the night.~
@431  = ~I have to talk to my sister Imoen about all this... I really have to.~
@432  = ~I need to talk to Jaheira... She is like a mother to me. I will go now, all right?~
@433  = ~I feel like talking to Viconia. In fact I am going to see her right now!~
@434  = ~I am going to spend this night in <PLAYER2>'s arms. I am sure that he is more hot-blooded than you.~
@435  = ~I am going to spend this night in <PLAYER3>'s arms. I am sure that he is more hot-blooded than you.~
@436  = ~I am going to spend this night in <PLAYER4>'s arms. I am sure that he is more hot-blooded than you.~
@437  = ~I am going to spend this night in <PLAYER5>'s arms. I am sure that he is more hot-blooded than you.~
@438  = ~I am going to spend this night in <PLAYER6>'s arms. I am sure that he is more hot-blooded than you.~
@439  = ~No man will understand how I feel right now. I need to talk to <PLAYER2>.~
@440  = ~No man will understand how I feel right now. I need to talk to <PLAYER3>.~
@441  = ~No man will understand how I feel right now. I need to talk to <PLAYER4>.~
@442  = ~No man will understand how I feel right now. I need to talk to <PLAYER5>.~
@443  = ~No man will understand how I feel right now. I need to talk to <PLAYER6>.~
@444  = ~Listen to me. Go if you need to, but do not do anything... anything rush. Please.~
@445  = ~You will open your legs to your brother to prove that I am a lesser man? I cannot believe that.~
@446  = ~Perhaps it would be better indeed for you to talk to a woman.~
@447  = ~I make sure that I watch my back tonight, then.~
@448  = ~So... is it over?~
@449  = ~Yes.~
@450  = ~No, Valygar. Please do not take my angry words in earnest.~
@451  = ~Oh, good. (Despite the brevity of Valygar's remark, his eyes lit up, making him appear less haggard.)~
@452  = ~Morning. Are you well?~
@453  = ~Quite well, thank you.~
@454  = ~No, I feel horrible. Let us not talk about anything right now.~
@455  = ~I do not want to talk to you again. EVER.~
@456  = ~What... (Valygar sighs.) Very well, suit yourself.~
@457  = ~(Valygar looks at you, hesitating for a short moment, before nodding and leaving you to your solitude.)~
@458  = ~I am here if you need me, <CHARNAME>.~
@459  = ~A strange thing happened this morning. I was walking about and found these little purple flowers. Before I knew what I was doing, I had picked a bunch and I don't have the heart to throw them away. Yet, before anybody else sees me carrying them around, would you mind taking the flowers? To save me the embarrassment?~
@460  = ~Those are violets. I wonder where did you manage to find them this time of year? I would wear them, but my attire is hardly fitting.~
@461  = ~You bring me violets, still covered with dew in the middle of this incessant battle. I'll wear them as a badge, as a sign that I am sworn to the band of hopeless romantics.~
@462  = ~Valygar, would you mind giving them to somebody else? It's not that I do not like the flowers, but... I am embarrassed as well.~
@463  = ~Now you are bringing me flowers... What's next? Are you going to ask to hold my hand before our next battle?~
@464  = ~Are you embarrassed of being in love with me or of picking flowers for me?~
@465  = ~Still more fitting than mine! Of course I can try to arrange them in the seam of my armor or attach them to my helmet. But <CHARNAME> please, do not make me do it.~
@466  = ~All right, I'll try to find a place for them... near my heart, of course.~
@467  = ~No way. I would look just as ridiculous as you. I am an adventurer after all! Would you mind giving the flowers to someone else instead?~
@468  = ~Ah, but it is so tempting to hang a few of those violets from the crest of your helmet!~
@469  = ~Valygar, how about we share this bunch and each wear some as a sign that we belong to the band of hopeless romantics?~
@470  = ~I know I said differently just a moment ago, but what you have just said... I want to divide the bunch in two and wear my half.~
@471  = ~Of course... I like sharing things with you, be it a dried out flatbread or a cup of wine or a blanket... (blush)~
@472  = ~Nope. They are all MINE.~
@473  = ~Ah, it is too tempting to pass on your offer. Here, let me hang a few of these violets from the crest of your helmet!~
@474  = ~It was for you that I picked the flowers. I have no desire to give them to anybody else.~
@475  = ~No, no, do not worry about that. I am a woodsman, not a ballroom twit or a paladin... And I am fighting with you, not participating in some silly jousting competition. I assure you, taking the flowers would not be followed by bad poetry reciting or piling dragonheads at your feet. Will you take the flowers?~
@476  = ~No way. I would look just as ridiculous as you. I am an adventurer, after all. Would you mind giving the flowers to someone else instead?~
@477  = ~All right, I'll try to find a place for them... near my heart of course... And I see no harm in couple of dragon heads or perhaps a very short poem. Just don't go overboard.~
@478  = ~Woodsman, you know more of romance than famous bards. I will wear the flowers you brought me in the midst of these incessant battles and I will wear them as a badge of honor. I love you, Valygar.~
@479  = ~I was never embarrassed of my love for you. But I thought myself too old and too callous to bring the flowers drenched with morning dew to my lady's pillow. I should not have said... <CHARNAME>, let us divide the bunch in two and each wear half.~
@480  = ~Of course, it is quite fitting that we do. It will be like a badge to show that we both belong to the same band -- the last of the romantics. Besides, I like sharing things with you, be it a dried out flatbread or a cup of wine or a blanket... (blush)~
@481  = ~Ah, it is too tempting to pass off your offer. Here, let me hang a few of these violets from the crest of your helmet!~
@482  = ~No, Valygar. I do not want the flowers from you. Maybe you should give them to someone else.~
@483  = ~My love, you look beautiful.~
@484  = ~Beware of the Knight of Violets, who strikes his foes down in the name of the most fair Lady <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep!~
@485  = ~I know that I said differently just a moment ago, but you put it in such a way that I find it hard to refuse. Let me put some in your hair... And now my bunch goes here. Beware of the Knight of Violets, who strikes his foes down in the name of the most fair Lady <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep!~
@486  = ~Or a bunch of flowers. I like it too, <CHARNAME>. Let me put some flowers in your hair... And now my bunch goes here. Beware of the Knight of Violets, who strikes his foes down in the name of the most fair Lady <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep!~
@487  = ~Of course they are yours, my love. They look beautifully on you.~
@488  = ~If you wish me to deliver you some trinkets like that, I think I should ask for some of those violets... to wear as the lady of my heart's favor, of course.~
@489  = ~Of course, it is quite fitting that you do. Besides, I like sharing things with you, be it a dried out flatbread or a cup of wine or a blanket... (blush)~
@490  = ~I am worried, <CHARNAME>. Generally, I agree with your tactics, but right now... Are you sure you know what you are doing? Are you sure there is a chance of defeating armies that your siblings have assembled? With only our small if brave company? Are you... thinking straight?~
@491  = ~What choice do I have, Valygar Corthala, to call the banners? Who will my bannermen be? You? Can the mighty House Corthala master a thousand horse or three thousand foot? Or do you think that Her Grace Queen Ellesime or the Great Duces of Baldur's Gate will send troops to support my cause? They did wish me a fine journey, and I am happy I got that from them. Or do you suggest I marshal the monks of Candlekeep into an army or round up some poor peasants?~
@492  = ~I do what I have always done, and so far I am faring just fine. I am not made to be a general, moving pieces on a map. Partisan warfare is more to my liking.~
@493  = ~Their armies are completely untrained, Valygar, no more than a bunch of religious fanatics who treat my siblings as cult figures. I figure that once my half-brothers and sisters fall, their armies will break and run. Or... now that I think about it, maybe they can be rounded up and sworn to serve ME instead.~
@494  = ~I admit that the issue is of grave concern to me, Count Corthala. Since you have experience serving in a regular army, maybe you can advise me what to do.~
@495  = ~I am a Daughter of Bhaal, Valygar. Armies before me are but a pile of kindling for a firestorm. Let them come! Mwa-ha-ha-ha!~
@496  = ~You are quite right. I'm doomed and my venture is hopeless. Yet, I will fight on to restore the peace in the Realm. I will not give up on that even if I will have to stand alone. Do you... do you wish to leave now?~
@497  = ~The only battle that matters is the one between my siblings and I for the heritage of our Sire, Valygar. The armies are a nuisance, monster fodder, no more than that. The mortals will part to allow the divine heirs to fight it out between themselves.~
@498  = ~Oh, Valygar... my dear... please, please let us not discuss such unpleasing things!~
@499  = ~Never question the actions of your superiors, Valygar. Did not they teach you at least that much in the army?~
@500  = ~Yes, I am. Haven't you ever heard that "Some names are worth a thousand mail-clad knights apiece"? We are an army, Valygar, though we may not look like one. Moreover, we have an impregnable fortress at the Pocket Plane to which we can retreat if our foes are overwhelming.~
@501  = ~I see. If I were you, I would not have brushed aside the possibility of raising an army so lightly. I grant that Yaga-Shura's band would have hardly accepted you as a leader after we defiled their temple, but Gromnir's troops, on the other hand, might have been brought under your banner.~
@502  = ~I do not want an army, Valygar. I have relied often on the more subtle ways of dispatching my opponents and I will do it now as well. With such people that I have under my command at present I can conquer the world if needed.~
@503  = ~Fate works differently when the divine is involved. The only battle that matters is the one between my siblings and I for the heritage of our Sire, and mortals will not decide its outcome.~
@504  = ~What's done is done. Maybe if the opportunity arises in the future, I will try to get more men under my command than I have now. Let us leave this discussion until such time when it will be relevant.~
@505  = ~Quit being so narrow-minded, mortal! I am a god-child and all will kneel to me in the end!~
@506  = ~You seem to be quite firm about your tactics. It did work well in the past, and as much as I hate the place, the Pocket Plane is a very fitting stronghold for what you are planning. But promise me to ponder gathering troops to at least have somebody opposing the robbery and destruction imposed on the peasants by your opponents.~
@507  = ~It is a sound advice, Valygar. I will see if I can do more about it.~
@508  = ~Those peasants you are so worried about would have hanged me if they could for being what I am. What do I care if their harvests burn, if they are robbed, raped and killed? I'm doing them a service by stopping my divine siblings. Let the mortals deal with each other.~
@509  = ~Unfortunately that is not something I can do, Valygar. I have to deal with a greater evil. Once it is destroyed, there will be time to bring the justice to its lackeys.~
@510  = ~They will break and run, but do you know what they will do after that? Many of them are now used to taking what they want at the point of a sword. I am glad that you are going to ponder creating your own army, if for nothing else than to have somebody opposing the robbery and destruction imposed on the peasants by the remnants of your opponents' armies.~
@511  = ~I suggest that you try to create an army of your own, whether by enlisting those whom we have defeated or by recruiting help in Suldanesellar or Baldur's Gate. If you would rather keep to our present tactics, than assigning a greater strategic significance to the Pocket Plain refuge can help.~
@512  = ~(Valygar carefully takes you by the shoulders) <CHARNAME>, please, stop laughing. You are scaring me.~
@513  = ~Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha...~
@514  = ~(Snicker) Gottcha! Come, Valygar, I am not an insane evil goddess to be. We are doing quite well, so why discard the winning strategy?~
@515  = ~Valygar, shaking me does not help the matters. In fact it can damage my precious mind. I will decide how to continue this campaign and all I need of you is your sword-hand. Or you are free to return to Athkatla.~
@516  = ~I am sorry, love, I do not know what came over me. Maybe you can offer me some advice?~
@517  = ~<CHARNAME>, my life goes before yours and I will not leave your side. But I do not think that we have no hope. We can and we shall win. Listen, we can create an army of our own, whether by enlisting those whom we have defeated or by recruiting help in Suldanesellar or Baldur's Gate. If you would rather keep to our present tactics, than assigning a greater strategic significance to the Pocket Plain refuge can help in combination with careful scouting missions.~
@518  = ~(Shakes his head) <CHARNAME>, you are not invincible or immortal, remember that. But even if you were... gathering troops will at the very least mean that somebody will oppose the robbery and destruction imposed on the peasants by your opponents and their armies.~
@519  = ~Discussing a winning strategy is not an unpleasant thing. What do you think has won your battles and kept you alive so far?~
@520  = ~Skill. Luck. Divinity. My shapely bottom. It must be one of those, certainly. Honestly, I do not know which one affected my enemies the most, but at least I know which one you are partial to.~
@521  = ~Oh, that... Well, we have been cutting through the enemy straight to their leader and making him or her into coleslaw. Works like a charm every time.~
@522  = ~Valygar, leave the thinking to me. NOW! Use your head to support your helmet, and we will all be just fine.~
@523  = ~As you say, my Lady.~
@524  = ~<CHARNAME>, none is invincible or immortal amongst us. Even if we were as powerful as you think... gathering troops will at the very least mean that somebody will oppose the robbery and destruction imposed on the peasants by your opponents and their armies.~
@525  = ~Possibly. Yet, <CHARNAME>, many mortals became involved in the conflict and are now being ground between the armies of your siblings.  Gathering troops will at the very least mean that somebody will oppose the robbery and destruction imposed on the peasants.~
@526  = ~I am glad that you are going to ponder on creating your own army, if for nothing else than to have somebody opposing the robbery and destruction imposed on the peasants by your opponents.~
@527  = ~Good. <CHARNAME>, I am always ready to help you with whatever is needed.~
@528  = ~That is what I am trying to say, <CHARNAME>. It does not have to be you who deals with all the grievances in the world. Find those of the like mind who will join with you and together we can set the matters right.~
@529  = ~<CHARNAME>! <CHARNAME>! Please... (Valygar shakes you).~
@530  = ~Out. Now.~
@531  = ~Never do it again, ranger. Never.~
@532  = ~Oh... What happened?~
@533  = ~<CHARNAME>, my life goes before yours and I will not leave your side.~
@534  = ~(Chuckles) As they say... in war and in love. However, <CHARNAME>, let us be serious for a moment. Your strategy of decisive strikes at the main opponent in a small force did work well in the past, and as much as I hate the place, the Pocket Plane is a very fitting stronghold for what you are planning. But promise me to consider gathering troops to at least have somebody opposing the robbery and destruction imposed on the peasants by your opponents.~
@535  = ~As you say.~
@536  = ~I... I am sorry. There was a need, <CHARNAME>. I cannot let you lose your control, for that is when your Sire can overwhelm you.~
@537  = ~(Valygar embraces you carefully) You were losing yourself. I am sorry... but I was afraid that your Sire was about to devour you.~
@538  = ~You remind me of a skylark I heard singing yesterday morn. It was high above the Toril, but yet not high enough so that his song couldn't reach the ground anymore... That's how you are. You are above us mortals, but you are still among us. Your power grows and my heart tells me that you are one of those who might join the gods one day. Would you fly high into the sky, given the choice?~
@539  = ~It's meaningless to ponder such things before the choice is offered, Valygar. I am a mortal woman for now, and as such I do not know what the future has in store for me. I care only of staying alive from dawn to dawn.~
@540  = ~I would, Valygar. There is no higher destiny on Toril.~
@541  = ~Me, a goddess? No, I'm not into it! I'd die from overexertion trying to do things right. A group of five or six people I can manage, but an army of power-hungry priests, fanatical devotees and annoying avatars? Nope, I want no part of it.~
@542  = ~I was born mortal and I will stay mortal. I wish to take all I can from life. Adventure, romance, family, friends and quiet retirement one day.~
@543  = ~You sound almost afraid, Valygar.~
@544  = ~I understand... You are a very sensible person <CHARNAME>. I hope you will not fly too far away from me one day.~
@545  = ~However far I am, Valygar, I will still love you and look after you.~
@546  = ~My soul, it pains me to say it, but we are bound to part all too soon. Yet it is you who are going to leave me in solitude for the centuries to come.~
@547  = ~Valygar, I doubted that it was wise for me to fall for you, because of the brevity of your years. Yet I do not regret a single hour spent with you. Enjoy what we have, my love, while we have it.~
@548  = ~Wow, someone is in need of cheering up! Come on, ranger, why worry of flying away and such? We are here and we are together. For now at least.~
@549  = ~So you have decided already. I see. Very well, do what you need to do. But remember that from so far away you will be just a speck to those you loved and who loved you. Their voices will be lost in the constant stream of your devotees' prayers.~
@550  = ~On second thought you may be right, Valygar. I... I cannot imagine how I should live without your love to warm up my days.~
@551  = ~And that's the way I want it.~
@552  = ~That's what I think now, Valygar. Though circumstances can change.~
@553  = ~I hope you are serious. I can never tell with you.~
@554  = ~Really? You want all those things? But that's wonderful! Well, I mean, it's wonderful that you know so well what you want.~
@555  = ~Yes, it is a good thing to know what one wants. What do you want, Valygar Corthala?~
@556  = ~Something has to be right and definite, Valygar. My present consists of cleaning up messes others have made and not allowing people and dead gods to make choices for me. So I hope that I will get a chance to live my own life, clean up my own messes and die my own death. I will never attain that if I ascend to Pantheon.~
@557  = ~I may yet change my opinion, though.~
@558  = ~I dreamt that I returned to the campsite and it was empty. I returned to you and...~
@559  = ~I was gone. I get the idea. Valygar, please do not make me answer this right now. For all we know we can die tomorrow. Let us enjoy what we have.~
@560  = ~Do not be afraid, ranger. I will always be waiting for you. Always. I promise.~
@561  = ~I must have ran away to find a featherbed in an inn, then. I am sick of sleeping on the collection of acorns, twigs and various crawling critters.~
@562  = ~And I will look after you. But they say that when you part with a loved one for a moment, you say your farewells for eternity. I wish to be by your side till the end, my <CHARNAME>.~
@563  = ~You are becoming possessive, ranger. I will come and go when I wish.~
@564  = ~There is a custom of old, which helps to accommodate such a desire, Valygar.~
@565  = ~These are troubled times, Valygar, and unfit for making promises. We can talk of love later, after the battles are fought and won.~
@566  = ~ I think I understand now why Lavok and Irenicus sought immortality. But however great is the temptation, I will not follow their path -- even for the promise of never parting with you. Instead I will ask you to live on after I am gone, <CHARNAME>. I wish you to be loved and to love again.~
@567  = ~For now... yes. <CHARANME>, I want you to know that I will have hard time letting you go. I do not want to be apart from you.~
@568  = ~My light, I do not want to be apart from you. There is little else I wish.~
@569  = ~I know that only a madman could desire the times like these to last, but I do not wish them to end, if the peace and quiet means losing you.~
@570  = ~My desires are simple, <CHARNAME>. I do not want to be apart from you. There is little else I wish.~
@571  = ~I understand you well. Too long I have lived in the shadow of my family past. But now it's fading. It would be a strange and beautiful thing to live our own lives, unhindered by others.~
@572  = ~ I hope... I hope that you will not.~
@573  = ~I doubt that I should go away. I do not want to be apart from you, <CHARNAME>.~
@574  = ~Funny. I thought that you did not mind my cloak for a bed and my shoulder for a pillow.~
@575  = ~I did not, but when the passion is over, twigs do bother me so. And you sleep like a log. A very frustrating experience.~
@576  = ~I would not deny that there are certain rewards in sleeping outdoors, especially in a company of a ranger.~
@577  = ~Ah, for that I am ready to suffer any inconveniences nature offers. Here, I promise that I will not run away to look for a featherbed.~
@578  = ~Yes, you will. Apparently, my desires count for little with you.~
@579  = ~I know... and I know what I have said to you before about it. (Places a palm over his eyes)~
@580  = ~<CHARNAME>, it will be for the best if we leave this conversation for now.~
@581  = ~Yes, yes, that's for the best.~
@582  = ~(Grins) Next time I will make you forget about twigs altogether.~
@583  = ~Indeed, there are. I will go over them with you as soon as we stop to rest, if you wish.~
@584  = ~(Smiles) Please, do not run away. Ever. I do not want to be apart from you.~
@585  = ~Everything shines about you: your eyes, your lips, your teeth, your hair... I think that in the nighttime one does not need a torch when you are around...~
@586  = ~Oh, that's such a lovely thing to say, thank you, Valygar.~
@587  = ~Yeah, and so does my armor!~
@588  = ~Sounds like I can apply for a job with a lighthouse!~
@589  = ~Valygar, you know, I feel a bit awkward when you say things like that in public.~
@590  = ~My pleasure... You are a delight to look upon.~
@591  = ~Yes, it does... Woman, do you have any flaws?~
@592  = ~(smile) Oh, aplenty, my love.~
@593  = ~I had none before falling in love with you.~
@594  = ~Not that I know of. I am perfection.~
@595  = ~(sighs) I was never good with words. I just wanted to tell you- ~
@596  = ~I know what you meant to say. And you said it very well.~
@597  = ~The words are fine, Valygar, but I do not wish to hear them from you.~
@598  = ~Well, just do not try to make it as a bard. You'd soon starve... and I want you alive.~
@599  = ~Am I a man to be ashamed of? A bandit? A vagrant?~
@600  = ~I am not ashamed of you, Valygar. I am just... erm... shy.~
@601  = ~I want to keep our love secret... I have no desire to hear a Ballad of Valygar and <CHARNAME> in an inn.~
@602  = ~A kinslayer, a son of necromancers and an exile from his own land. You are not exactly Tethir the Dragonslayer, you know.~
@603  = ~The only woman without flaws I have seen was that statue of illithium that Sir Sales wrought for the temple of Helm. What man would love dead metal? (chuckles) Another statue perhaps.~
@604  = ~Ah, but that's a virtue in my eyes.~
@605  = ~(grins) I can always muss your hair or put your clothes in total disorder.~
@606  = ~(laughs) You are an enchantress, <CHARNAME>, capable of making a grim woodsman to spout poetry.~
@607  = ~(dryly) What is that supposed to mean?~
@608  = ~It means that I have come to my senses and finally decided to be rid of you.~
@609  = ~I just want to keep our relationship secret, Valygar.~
@610  = ~I am not mad enough to ask people to pay money to listen to me sing.~
@611  = ~Do not be. We have wronged no one. And if some idle tongue dares to say anything to hurt you, I-~
@612  = ~It is *you* I worry about, Valygar Corthala. A son of necromancers, a kinslayer, an exile from your own land and now a lover to the Bhaal's daughter!~
@613  = ~No, you would not! Is there not enough blood spilt on my account already?~
@614  = ~You'll what? Lie to them, that I am your wedded wife, not your whore?~
@615  = ~Is not that better than the Ballad of <CHARNAME>, the Daughter of Murder?~
@616  = ~(Quietly) We *are* dragon-slayers, <CHARNAME>. But if I am not good enough for you- ~
@617  = ~You are. But let us be... more discreet.~
@618  = ~Silly, it is *you* I worry about. I do not think that adding 'lover of Bhaal's daughter' to the insipid rumors about you should help anything.~
@619  = ~You will do. For now.~
@620  = ~You are not.~
@621  = ~All my life gossip has perverted my deeds. But I want it to be said that Valygar Corthala has loved <CHARNAME>, and it does not matter to me, what ungainly details would be added.~
@622  = ~(darkly) You are right.~
@623  = ~I would not lie, if I say that.~
@624  = ~In my heart you are my wife.~
@625  = ~(Valygar looks at you, startled.)~
@626  = ~I joked, ranger. (You hug Valygar tightly) You are what I want.~
@627  = ~I am sorry, Valygar, but it is true. I wish I could love you the way you deserve to be loved.~
@628  = ~(Valygar kisses you.) And you are what I want.~
@629  = ~Perhaps, half-heartedly is how I deserved to be loved.~
@630  = ~<CHARNAME> -~
@631  = ~Cut, cut, cut! Heartbreaking! Nerve racking! Humanoids take leave of all senses when the little ladylove comes calling.~
@632  = ~<CHARNAME>, quit staring at this tree trunk on two legs! My drow friend here won't take him as a substitute for your fair, gentle and deadly self. So it is either you fighting Captain Egeissag in a spectacular single combat, or we messily, yet efficiently attack you en masse.~
@633  = ~Listen you two! Anyone who wants to swing a blade her way has to cross it with mine first. <CHARNAME>, your life is precious, you are the only one who can oppose your mad sibling's plans. <CHARNAME>, allow me to... ahem... champion you.~
@634  = ~Valygar, no! I was challenged and I shall answer the challenge.~
@635  = ~Ranger, I stand better chance to defeat the drow, than you. Therefore if we shall have this duel, I will fight.~
@636  = ~You want to champion me, Valygar? CHAMPION? Had you already placed your application with the Order of the things radiant? I will not have this nonsense from you!~
@637  = ~Valygar, I... (giggle) It is so awkward...~
@638  = ~I will accept you as my champion, Valygar.~
@639  = ~By the Nine Hells, it took all sorts to make your family! Before I ran into you I thought I lived dangerously, but I have never met a dragon. Let alone a dragon that calls my lover a sister.~
@640  = ~(Coldly) Half-sister. But I concede, that it does not make it any less strange.~
@641  = ~(Saccharine) I am glad that you are enjoying slaughtering MY relatives... for a change.~
@642  = ~Makes me wonder how many Bhaalspawn were... erm... conceived.~
@643  = ~I regret the necessity of this kill. Dragons are magnificent creatures -- much more arcane than natural. Some say that the day the last dragon dies, so will magic.~
@644  = ~What puzzles me is that Bhaal could bring forth the spawn of dragons and fire giants -- the powerful, greedy races. Why then did he bother with lesser peoples? ~
@645  = ~So sayeth a puny human who has just slain a dragon.~
@646  = ~Perhaps quantity mattered to him more than quality, so he went for those who multiply quicker and in greater numbers. I do not know how many of... us were conceived, however.~
@647  = ~Murder, Valygar, is a thing that equates a greater and a lesser. A gnome can take down a dragon.~
@648  = ~I have never enjoyed killing, <CHARNAME> and if I have to answer the charge of kinslaying be it to you or to anyone else... I did not kill my parents and Lavok, <CHARNAME>, I allowed for the deaths that came after them to occur.~
@649  = ~So, you are better than I.~
@650  = ~You are deluding yourself, ranger. You took the lives of those who were not prepared to die.~
@651  = ~Let us talk of dragons, Valygar, before hot words pull us apart. Erm... dragons are magnificent creatures, much more arcane than natural. Some say that the day the last dragon dies, so will magic.~
@652  = ~It is difficult to say. I have counted about thirty of those who had announced themselves as Bhaalspawn or could have been Bhaalspawn in Saradush. Another five we know of... perhaps others in whom the taint did not manifest itself or who were killed long ago, Imoen, Sarevok -~
@653  = ~Stop it! (Shudder) There are too many who are dead already. I will never know what they were like... what if there was another Imoen among them?~
@654  = ~(Coldly) <CHARNAME>... Do not exclude her from the list.~
@655  = ~So, perhaps fifty, and perhaps hundred, and perhaps even more. (Sigh) We have a job to do, and alas, this job is killing.~
@656  = ~(Quietly) Yes. So they say.~
@657  = ~Valygar... you cannot seriously wish for magic to disappear, can you? Imagine the world without it... Elves gone forever to the lands beyond our reach, dragon skulls piled in some cellar and an annoying gnome showing to a group of adolescents the sure proof that they are a fake.~
@658  = ~Would you kill Aladon to have that?~
@659  = ~Ah! (Slap yourself on the forehead) Silly me! Valygar, how come that we never get these uneasy moments when we kiss more and talk less?~
@660  = ~I am not a puny human, <CHARNAME>. Your destiny has shaped myself and others who were your companions. We have died with you and were reborn as people who... probably do not belong to our own races any longer. I believe... I believe that we are better killers than anyone else on Toril.~
@661  = ~(shake your head) Murder is a thing that equates a greater and a lesser. A gnome can take down a dragon... or us.~
@662  = ~Hmmm... That opens certain interesting possibilities. Say, lover, what do you think about becoming a Chosen of <CHARNAME> after I ascend?~
@663  = ~YES! We are FABULOUS!~
@664  = ~Murder does not equate anyone. Sometimes, however, it robs the world of the greater to let the lesser triumph.~
@665  = ~Why are you doing it, woman? I love you more than life and you... sometimes I feel that you bend me and twist me, as an amused child bends a toy to see when it breaks. What do you think you are doing?~
@666  = ~(Calmly) Breaking you.~
@667  = ~I... I do not know, Valygar. I feel that I will have no rest until I have every truth about you. I do not do it to hurt you, I just need to know what you are...~
@668  = ~It is a cruel sort of curiosity. It is not idle, beloved, yet I will try not to torment you again with thorny questions.~
@669  = ~Darling... (touches your cheek lightly with his fingertips) darling, there is no telling now. But I know that those, who fought us, were not listening to the offers of peace you were making.~
@670  = ~Perhaps I was not trying hard enough.~
@671  = ~This sounds... like an excuse, Valygar.~
@672  = ~(Nod) So you think that they were deservingly punished, for not bending their knees to <CHARNAME>?~
@673  = ~(Wordlessly you embrace Valygar. It is comforting to know, that someone sees your actions in the true light)~
@674  = ~I feel such pity for you at times, my light. Yet I see no way out.~
@675  = ~Kill me and you will have your way out, ranger. Perhaps, you will be able to sell my head for a good coin to boot.~
@676  = ~Maybe you do not see it, my love, but you offer it. Your every word, your every glance, your every kiss are the cobblestones of that road.~
@677  = ~Let us change the subject, Valygar... before I cry. Erm... dragons are magnificent creatures, much more arcane, than natural. Some say, that the day the last dragon dies, so will magic.~
@678  = ~Can your kin live if the Weave is destroyed?~
@679  = ~I do not know, Valygar... and I do not want to know.~
@680  = ~Why won't you check it? If you destroy the Weave and I drop dead by your feet you will have your answer.~
@681  = ~Valygar, how come that we never get these uneasy moments when we kiss more and talk less?~
@682  = ~It may be... it may be worth it, for all the evil things that are wrought with magic, for all the destruction it brings...~
@683  = ~Gorion told me once of the smoke powder of Gond. It takes no magic to make it, but it is as destructive as dragon's breath.~
@684  = ~No, it is not!~
@685  = ~I do not know... but I love the taste of the remedy (Valygar kisses you.)~
@686  = ~You have almost succeeded today. I do not know why you desire to do it, but... I will not let you.~
@687  = ~Nobody knows me as well as you do, <CHARNAME>. My own mother did not. (sighs)~
@688  = ~I... I will be gentler than her. I will be gentler than anyone has ever been to you, I promise. I have always wanted to... I just did not know that you needed it.~
@689  = ~NO! We are NOT talking of your mother!~
@690  = ~Thank you... Can you turn away for a moment? You... you do not want to see me cry, do you?~
@691  = ~I am a woodsman, darling, not a sage like your stepfather. I need time to think things through. I do see, however, that much of it depends on who wields the power, magical or not. Perhaps I should not speak in haste.~
@692  = ~(Smiles) Which one of us is more stubborn?~
@693  = ~I'll stop talking then.~
@694  = ~Every time we return to the Pocket Plane I feel an urge to take you away from there to a marble palace or a proud castle. This place is awful, <CHARNAME>. But I can offer no more than the palaces that the wind builds in the sky from clouds or a sand castle on the riverbank.~
@695  = ~Gromnir had a palace. It did not make him happy. Neither was Lady Delicia De'Arnise content, living behind the tall castle walls.~
@696  = ~The Nine Hells are my place, Valygar. Nobody can take me from there. Neither you, nor anyone.~
@697  = ~You are forgetting about a small cabin in Umar Hills, Valygar.~
@698  = ~Bah! Adventuring is a good business. Or <MONEY> gold aren't enough for you? Two shares from our booty should be enough to buy a bloody mansion, if not a castle.~
@699  = ~You are neither Gromnir, not Lady Delcia, <CHARNAME>.~
@700  = ~And neither I was born a Lady of the Castle. I would not know what to do with all the splendor and servants of a lordly residence. Your arms around me comfort better than any featherbed, and I prefer looking into your eyes to peering at bright frescos on the ceilings.~
@701  = ~We probably can buy a decent estate with our shares of booty. (Shrug) adventuring brings in good money.~
@702  = ~No, I am not. I have no desire to become a miserly mortal Lady. I will have the Throne of my Sire, and I shall sit it here, in the Nine Hells.~
@703  = ~Your Umar Hills Hold, Count, will suffice.~
@704  = ~No, and that is why I prefer a cloud castle or a palace made of sand.~
@705  = ~Look up then... (Valygar lays his arm around your waist and puts his chin on your shoulder. With his free hand he points at the towering clouds) Here are the walls of white and round towers. The roofs are painted with lapis-lazuli and gilded with gold.~
@706  = ~(Sighs) I am hopeless.~
@707  = ~Yes, you are. Perhaps you are better with sand?~
@708  = ~No, no. (You press your cheek against Valygar's and make him look up again) I can see it! Do you see our white banners over the towers, Valygar? Oh! And look, the shutters are of the mother of pearl...only we and the Sea-elf king have those!~
@709  = ~(Laugh) You are wonderful! Listen, I like this castle in the sky... Let us keep it. But for the day-to-day life, I prefer a certain log cabin in Umar Hills.~
@710  = ~My family's colors are not white and blue anyway. Our sigil is black and red and our hold is in the Nine Hells.~
@711  = ~(Quietly) I hope that I can.~
@712  = ~Your hope is a false one, ranger.~
@713  = ~(Take Valygar's hand) Perhaps, we can defeat my Sire yet, and my siblings. I was wrong to despair, my love.~
@714  = ~(Smile) Do you know that it is my favorite place in the world? The forest is old there, and the trees stand tall and mighty. The game is plentiful and the creek's water is clear. There is a bluff you have not seen yet, near the river, where the pines with red trunks grow. In the summer the air smells of resin and needles, and the white sands underfoot are warm long into the nights. But it is a quiet place, and the folks, while friendly are rough. Immensvale is but a small village...~
@715  = ~(Throw your arms about Valygar's neck) Ah, we will be so happy there! You will hunt and I will wait for you on the wooden steps in the afternoons. And the tablecloth will be white banded with embroidery, and I won't know where to put yet another bunch of wild flowers you bring me... (Sigh) One day, Valygar...~
@716  = ~(Sadly) Yes, you are right, it is too rustic. But it is good for a short while, and we can always settle somewhere else...~
@717  = ~Then we shall go there, but first we will see all that is in the realms. There will be time aplenty for idle happiness when we are older.~
@718  = ~<CHARNAME>... Adventuring is a business of killing people... I am worried about what it does to you. I would like to take you away from it as well as from the Pocket Plane. For at least a little while, my love, so you could catch your breath and remember that there are other things to life than battles and booty.~
@719  = ~Perhaps you are right. I've grown rougher and sometimes I do not like myself all that much. Let us sort out my mad siblings, and go somewhere...to Umar Hills perhaps?~
@720  = ~I cannot see doing anything else, but adventuring, Valygar. I am capable of staying unsoiled by the more base urges of a mercenary.~
@721  = ~You can take <CHARNAME> away from Pocket Plane, but you cannot take the Nine Hells away from <CHARNAME>, Valygar...~
@722  = ~Would you...would you consider living in Umar Hills, <CHARNAME>?~
@723  = ~If I had faith in any deity, I would pray. I could not, so all that was left to me was to hope that I can convince you to abandon this terrible thing. I hoped that I could take you away from your past, your heritage, from this terrible place! ~
@724  = ~You can be very convincing, beloved...~
@725  = ~(Grins) I used to be able to build sandcastles. In Umar Hills, there was a sandy beach by the river shore and I spent hours playing there once upon a time. I promise, I shall dust of my skills and build something for you if you come with me.~
@726  = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, your love is always a wonder to me.... (Kisses you gently on your cheek) How could I be so childish and present you with an airy dream, instead of stone halls? (Shakes his head) Even a sand castle is sturdier than the clouds...~
@727  = ~(Sighs) Your accursed father placed the worst duty of all on your shoulders - to cleanse the world of his poisonous spirit. Once that is done...~
@728  = ~You have my word, then, that if I live, the very day that the blood flood recedes, I will take you away to the place where we can live in peace.~
@729  = ~I am a man of simple dreams, <CHARNAME>. All I want is to live in peace with you. Perhaps I can hang my sword on the wall, when I cannot wield it any longer to defend you, and you can return to me, when the time comes for you to take the same decision.~
@730  = ~When I walk over the fallen leaves I often think that those are the past days of my life. Some are bright, some dark, some half-rotten... But it does not matter any more. The past is the past and future we know not. What we need to worry about is today. Do you agree, <CHARNAME>?~
@731  = ~Melancholy does not suit you, Valygar. But you are right: who gives a damn about the past? And what is the point to try to guess what is in store for us? Today is real. Let's try to make it a great day.~
@732  = ~Both the past and the future are important. Today is the consequence of yesterday's doings. Tomorrow is what we are looking forward to, when the things get rough.~
@733  = ~(Sighs) The desires of my siblings are about to come true: I am going to die of boredom, talking to you.  Is that what you want?~
@734  = ~I guess, I'll try to be more cheerful to please you next time I speak to you. As of late I do not care much for anything in my past that was not connected to you. I do not care what is in store for tomorrow as long as I can be around you.~
@735  = ~I...I do not know what to say... ~
@736  = ~Valygar, let's not continue this conversation. Do not walk on the thin ice, for you might fall through it and drown.~
@737  = ~(Stay silent)~
@738  = ~I feel the same way, Valygar.~
@739  = ~Maybe... I am nearing thirty and all that has passed cannot be washed away from my soul by soap or by ale. But as of late I do not care much for anything in my past that was not connected to you. I do not care what is in store for tomorrow as long as I can be around you.~
@740  = ~I feel the same way Valygar.~
@741  = ~No, we can't have that.~
@742  = ~Say nothing then...~
@743  = ~I am not easily frightened, <CHARNAME>.~
@744  = ~You give me hope that one day there will be more to our lives than swords and spells... But...even now we need to go.~
@745  = ~You give me hope that one day there would be more to our lives than swords and spells... But...even now we need to go.~
@746  = ~<CHARNAME>, I've been thinking for a while about my family's curse.~
@747  = ~You mean the affinity for magic so many of your relatives had?~
@748  = ~Valygar, if you want to tell me once again that you are dangerous to me because of the curse, please do not. I will not surrender the closeness we share now, not for a thousand curses!~
@749  = ~(Your hand finds Valygar's and you smile at him tenderly)~
@750  = ~Yes, and I have come to doubt that my family's curse is the obsession with magic. ~
@751  = ~(You look at Valygar in surprise and ask softly: "Really?")~
@752  = ~(Quietly) Of course it was not, dear. You are not doomed and neither am I for being with you, nor will our children be if we live long enough to have any.~
@753  = ~I am going to open a bottle of wine to celebrate the occasion, ranger.~
@754  = ~Beloved, you sound bitter and sad. Why? Our love is stronger than any curse, whatever it might be.~
@755  = ~I would fight all the beasts of the Nine Hells myself to keep you near me!~
@756  = ~(He chuckles bitterly) And I just confirmed what I started to suspect some time ago. Corthala's curse, <CHARNAME>... perhaps, it's not the obsession with magic. ~
@757  = ~Then what is it, Valygar Corthala?~
@758  = ~Beloved, you sound bitter and sad. Why? Our love is stronger than any curse, don't you know?~
@759  = ~Bring it on, ranger. Together we can fight anything cruel fate cares to throw our way. Curses, monsters, mad mages, murderous siblings - you name it.~
@760  = ~Stop this farce, Valygar! I have no use for doomed heroes and tragic love stories.~
@761  = ~(Valygar's eyes darken, he leans over you and kisses you passionately) ~
@762  = ~(As Valygar's lips find yours it becomes absolutely irrelevant to you what he was about to say. You let your fingers slide under his shirt.)~
@763  = ~Mmmgh...you were saying something about...mmmgh... the family curse?~
@764  = ~Yes...I came to realize that I am drawn to you unquestioningly, blindly, insatiably - the same way my ancestors were drawn to magic... Obsession itself is Corthala's curse, not an obsession with anything or anyone in particular. Do you understand now?~
@765  = ~That you are a passionate man? I understood that long ago, Valygar. Only that's no curse, silly. It's a blessing...~
@766  = ~Your mother - in the end her passion for magic was replaced by guilt and love for your father...which became an obsession. Lavok's only wish was to die in Athkatla, so strong was his nostalgia. You followed <CHARNAME> to the Nine Hells and beyond. Is that the way the Corthala's curse works then?~
@767  = ~How...how can you say so? After all we have been through...after...after you kissed tears off my cheeks when I cried, after you fell asleep in my arms... how can you tell me that our love is a...curse?~
@768  = ~Unquestioningly, blindly, insatiably - it is the way I love you, Valygar. It has nothing to do with Corthalas. You are not doomed and neither am I for being with you, nor will our children be if we live long enough to have any.~
@769  = ~I came to realize that I am drawn to you unquestioningly, blindly, insatiably - the same way my ancestors were drawn to magic... Obsession itself is Corthala's curse, not an obsession with anything or anyone in particular. Do you understand now?~
@770  = ~<CHARNAME>...forgive me for what I am about to say. I know that I will sounds like a fool breaking his own happiness. But the way I love you - unquestioningly, blindly, insatiably - the same way my ancestors were drawn to magic... Obsession itself is Corthala's curse, not an obsession with anything or anyone in particular. Do you understand now?~
@771  = ~So be it. Perhaps it is for the best that we part, because I came to realize that I am drawn to you unquestioningly, blindly, insatiably - the same way my ancestors were drawn to magic... Obsession itself is Corthala's curse, not an obsession with anything or anyone in particular. Do you understand now?~
@772  = ~You are so beautiful. The way I am drawn to you... unquestioningly, blindly, insatiably... the same way my ancestors were drawn to magic... Do you understand now?~
@773  = ~I thought...I thought that I am drawn to you...unquestioningly, blindly, insatiably...in the same way my ancestors were drawn to magic... I thought that obsession itself is Corthala's curse, not an obsession with anything or anyone in particular. But what you have said - I want to believe it. Maybe I simply cannot comprehend simple happiness, after years of threats and despair?~
@774  = ~Let me teach you happiness, beloved.~
@775  = ~Your mother - in the end her passion for magic was replaced by guilt and love for your father...which became an obsession. Lavok's only wish was to die in Athkatla, so strong was his nostalgia...You followed <CHARNAME> to the Nine Hells and beyond. Maybe it is the way the Corthala's curse work!~
@776  = ~(Sadly) There is nothing to celebrate, <CHARNAME>. I came to realize that I am drawn to you unquestioningly, blindly, insatiably - the same way my ancestors were drawn to magic... Obsession itself is Corthala's curse, not an obsession with anything or anyone in particular. Do you understand now?~
@777  = ~Your mother -- in the end her passion for magic was replaced by guilt and love for your father...which became an obsession. Lavok's only wish was to die in Athkatla, so strong was his nostalgia...... You followed <CHARNAME> to the Nine Hells and beyond. Maybe that is the way the Corthala's curse works!~
@778  = ~Oh, but you just gave me the reason. If you think that your love for me is a curse - I do not see why we should be together. Drink with me to our freedom, Valygar.~
@779  = ~You are not safe with me, can't you see?!~
@780  = ~(laugh) Valygar, you are talking to the woman, whose soul was ripped out of her, who had assassins on her heels for close to two years now, and who has armies against her...and you are saying it is not *safe* for me to be loved by you? As far as the curses go, yours is a pimple on the giant's ass, compared to my own.~
@781  = ~I have never played it safe in love, Valygar, and I am not going to start now. Valygar, I swear my love to you and I swear that it is unaffected by Bhaal's taint, Mystra's weave, the plots of Baldur's Gate Dukes or Cowled Wizards. I swear that I would have loved you even if your last name was Tumsk or Remez or...any else. I would love you nameless, I would love you in any clothes (or without any clothes at all), in any country and in any time.~
@782  = ~Valygar, if happiness is too foreign to you - I can do nothing about it. I tried so hard to make you heart beat faster - and what did I achieve? That you think my love a curse! You know what? Drink with me to our freedom, Valygar, and drink slowly. Because once the last drop of wine is gone you are nobody to me.~
@783  = ~(Quietly) I think so. And that means that you are not safe with me.~
@784  = ~(Laugh) Valygar, you are talking to the woman, whose soul was ripped out of her, who had assassins on her heels for close to two years now, and who has armies against her...and you are saying it is not *safe* for me to be loved by you? As far as the curses go, yours is a pimple on the giant's ass, compared to my own.~
@785  = ~No, not your love for me. That is as pure and precious a gem that has ever existed. But my love for you...you deserve better than that. You are not safe with me.~
@786  = ~What you have just said - I want to believe it. Maybe I am mistaken? Maybe I cannot comprehend simple happiness, after years of threats and despair? ~
@787  = ~Then let me teach you happiness, beloved.~
@788  = ~Doubts. Every moment with you brings doubts. I fight, but they come back, like some ugly tribe of goblins. Let today be the day we deal with them once and for all. Valygar, I swear my love to you and I swear that it is unaffected by Bhaal's taint, Mystra's weave, the plots of Baldur's Gate Dukes or Cowled Wizards. I swear that I would have loved you even if your last name was Tumsk or Remez or...any else. I would love you nameless, I would love you in any clothes (or without any clothes at all), in any country and in any time.~
@789  = ~(Valygar kisses lightly the tips of your fingers) You do not need to do anything, but be. You are my happiness, <CHARNAME>.~
@790  = ~(laughs) You have a rare talent to prove a man wrong. Maybe I should be grateful for my curse, for they rarely are that sweet.~
@791  = ~You are right. Let the curses burn in the Nine Hells! If we must die, then let us die with the memory of the taste of a lover's lips.~
@792  = ~I am not foreign to happiness, <CHARNAME>. But I cannot have you paying for it. The curse had already taken its hold on me. Sometimes, the only thing that one can do in the name of love is to leave... ~
@793  = ~No! I forbid you to think such stupid thoughts! I forbid you to leave me because of fears and curses and forebodings! Against it all we should stand together and fight for our love.~
@794  = ~If you indeed love me...you will not leave me. Ever. Look into your heart, ranger, and look carefully.~
@795  = ~My heart surely cannot hurt worst than it does now.~
@796  = ~Did not I just say that I do not care any more?~
@797  = ~Let the fate name its price. I am ready to pay with my own life for the right to call you my lover.~
@798  = ~I promised you once to fight your cause in exchange for your help against Corthala's bane. In the beginning it was the sort of a battle that is won with a sword in hand, but it's just became different. It is a battle against destiny. The only weapon we have is our love - ~
@799  = ~And it is in battles where a sword comes alive, not on the wall of the smithy!~
@800  = ~Only one... but indestructible, Valygar. Or does your heart tell you differently?~
@801  = ~Yes, yes, very good. Now, that we have sorted yet another one of your nervous fits, we should move on.~
@802  = ~My heart tells me that while we are together we are invincible and can take any challenge.~
@803  = ~I did not want to hurt you... and yet I did. Please, forgive me, <CHARNAME>, for being such an oaf.~
@804  = ~Then I lost you. Was not that what I wanted? Then why does it taste so bitter? Well, there is nothing to it, but to say a toast.~
@805  = ~I am obsessed, therefore I live... Cheers, <CHARNAME>.~
@806  = ~And so do I. It is your name I cry out when I go into battles, because if I should die, I want it to be the last thing that my lips tasted. It is you that I enclose in my arms to shield against the world, and yet feel protected against ill myself. It is your touch that makes me alive... Leaving you is a slow death, but I did not know until now that you felt the same.~
@807  = ~Last night I dreamed of the ocean, <CHARNAME>. And of my mother. All I have left of her is the name of the village in northern Zakhara that she came from. She used to promise me that one day we'd take a ship and voyage to Zakhara.... It never came to be.~
@808  = ~That's so sad. May be one day you can travel there on your own and see your people...~
@809  = ~Where is Zakhara? It's far away, right? What was your mother's name? How did she end up in Athkatla? Why-~
@810  = ~Well, you cannot do anything about it now, can you? You mother is, erm... dead, is she not?~
@811  = ~Valygar, must you be so dour the first thing in the morning? Perhaps, a little bit of love would cheer you up?~
@812  = ~Maybe. I do not know. I think sometimes about building a ship and sailing to Zakhara.~
@813  = ~Ranger on the high seas...(You hug Valygar tightly) Valygar, do hire a crew of mariners, if you decide to sail. Or I will be worrying the whole time!~
@814  = ~That sounds so romantic...~
@815  = ~Yeah, sure. Whatever you say.~
@816  = ~Alas, you cannot do it right now, but perhaps... perhaps you can tell me about your mother? Who was she? How did she come to Athkatla?~
@817  = ~It seems I bore you. I will stop talking, then.~
@818  = ~I did not know that my past was so interesting to you. Zakhara is a large land south from Faerun and that's where my mother came from. Magdelene was her name.~
@819  = ~Tell me more, dear.~
@820  = ~Perhaps, one day, you can go to this mysterious land and learn more of your people. It is rather frightening to be all alone in the world, without a soul to call your kin. I know that.~
@821  = ~They also call it the Land of Fate, do they not it? I think you ought to go there, even if you do it alone. It may heal the wound in your heart that opens and bleeds every time you speak of your mother.~
@822  = ~You mean: I killed her? Not her, an undead monster Magdelene Corthala became... still, it always haunted me. I never really knew her. She was always too busy studying magic to talk to me when I was growing up - and later I rejected her. Youth is arrogant and does not forgive the mistakes of their elders. Until it is too late to fix them.~
@823  = ~Tell me more of your mother, dear.~
@824  = ~It's never too late, Valygar. Your heart is full of questions about your mother... there has to be a way of finding the answers.~
@825  = ~Indeed. Let us leave it to the past to bury the dead. Today is another day and you are loved, Valygar. Loved more than any other man ever was.~
@826  = ~I would hire help to build the ship, of course... But I also thought about help of another kind... Do you think that one day, when your quest is over, you might want to come along? I will steer the ship and you will sing to the winds and waves to make our passage a pleasure.~
@827  = ~Hmm, I must tell you that I have other obligations after my quest is done... Sorry, Valygar, it seems that you will have to go on your own, but I wish you the very best of luck. I will wait for your return.~
@828  = ~No, I would not: that's too much of a commitment for a fling. I am sure you will find someone else to sit under the white sails of your ship, Valygar.~
@829  = ~I would. But only if your navigational skills are better then my singing... Otherwise the ship would sink before lifting anchor.~
@830  = ~After this quest is over, I will either become a Goddess or a corpse. If I am to ascend I promise you that I will watch after the sail on the Sea of Swords and bid Chaundakul for a favorable wind.~
@831  = ~I will come with you, Valygar. But I am afraid that day may be far away...~
@832  = ~Do you think that one day, when your quest is over, you'd want to come along, my light? I will steer the ship and you will sing to the winds and waves to make our passage a pleasure.~
@833  = ~As far as I know she was a war mage on a ship, which stopped in Athkatla. That's how she met my father. I think it was a turbulent romance, but in the end she married my father for Corthala's secret knowledge, not for himself. ~
@834  = ~Surely you are mistaken! What Magdelene did in the end tells how much she truly loved her husband, even if the things she did were twisted and ugly!~
@835  = ~Valygar, if your father was anything like you... take it from the woman who knows what she is talking about - Magdelene did not give a rat's ass about Corthala's secrets when she wed him. Though if the way Corthalas kiss is as inherent as their curse... she might have been curious about a thing or two, not exactly unrelated to magic. A nocturnal sort of magic. And if you ask me if I meant necromancy I'll hit you!~
@836  = ~(Hug Valygar) Silly man! I promise you, that if I were wed to Corthala... Well, I guess no ifs, but you are loved for yourself, Valygar. Loved more than a man ever was.~
@837  = ~In you I found my kin and my soul-mate, <CHARNAME>. I hope that you feel the same way about me.~
@838  = ~There is nobody in the world closer and dearer to me than you, my love.~
@839  = ~But blood is thicker than water. It will be good for you to find your roots.~
@840  = ~Hope, they say, dies last. When will you understand that a Daughter of Murder cannot have kin?~
@841  = ~I have no way of knowing if people of the Land of Fate would embrace me, or if they'd curse my father and myself for killing their sister. But... but I am ready to gamble and I will accept their judgment as just.~
@842  = ~Every time my heart beats, it says "<CHARNAME>".~
@843  = ~We can both learn. Or if we are hopeless, we can buy a passage on a merchant ship. It might not be so beautiful, but... ~
@844  = ~Do finish the sentence, Valygar.~
@845  = ~But we will be together, and that's all that matters to me.~
@846  = ~No, not a merchant ship. It will be the most beautiful and the fastest galleon to sail the sea. Its sails will be of scarlet silk and the prow will be gilded gold. And it will have the most tactful captain and crew in the world; people who mind their own business. Ah, it's a pity that we cannot go right now.~
@847  = ~Better ask him to send a hurricane and a fleet of corsairs. If I were to lose you, I would need to flee the pain and torment inside me. I know of nothing that could fill the void, but with a sword in my hand I would at least feel alive.~
@848  = ~You are too smart and too old to give that much significance to one woman's presence in your life.~
@849  = ~You sound as if you intend to court death, should I ascend. Do not, Valygar. My love will be with you forever and it would hurt me to see you wasting away before your time. You are destined for great things.~
@850  = ~If you wish.~
@851  = ~It does not matter how far away that day is. The plans are laid and I will do my best to help you through the terrible mess your heritage turned your life into. Just stay alive and I will wait as long as is required.~
@852  = ~You take care of yourself too, Valygar.~
@853  = ~(Smile) Of course.~
@854  = ~O, my steadfast hero, how I long for the day when living will replace staying alive for us.~
@855  = ~Perhaps, you are right, but I will never know the answer. Yet, if I travel to Zakhara I will find peace of mind at last.~
@856  = ~(Chuckles) You must have meant conjuring then. (Shields himself mockingly, as if expecting an attack) My love, you make me feel a fool, but a happy fool. Yet, to find my peace of mind I think I must travel to Zakhara.~
@857  = ~Is that why you chose me from among all the men who looked at you in hope? Because I have sworn to have no family of my own? Then you have erred! I love you, and I want to stay with you to the end. Think on that, <CHARNAME>, and maybe you will finally understand, the way I did, that gods, blood, curses and fate all together are not worth a rat's ass.~
@858  = ~(Quietly) But we would still be together.~
@859  = ~I knew you would say that. I like this idea very much!~
@860  = ~Well, some of our companions may join in the venture. (Smile) As long as they are discrete.~
@861  = ~On the second thought I changed my mind. I do not want to go anywhere alone with you. It feels too much like a commitment.~
@862  = ~I am tired of being destined. Is that why you chose me, from all men who look at you in hope? Because I have sworn to have no family of my own? Then you have erred! I love you, and I want to stay with you to the end. Think on that, <CHARNAME>, and maybe you will finally understand the way I did that gods, blood, curses and fate all together are not worth a rat's ass.~
@863  = ~I do.~
@864  = ~I am happy to hear that.~
@865  = ~(smiles) That's how we will do it.~
@866  = ~Do you remember Kamir?~
@867  = ~I do not recall anyone named Kamir, Valygar.~
@868  = ~Kamir? He was the paladin whom we talked into becoming a guardian for an orphaned girl, right?~
@869  = ~Yes, I do remember him as a matter of fact. His son died while he was away, and he seemed to be inconsolable. Why did you speak of him to me? Such thoughts lead to bleakness, and I cannot let my spirit to be subdued. I have to believe that there is hope, and there is happiness somewhere in this world, if I am to stand up and fight.~
@870  = ~What about him?~
@871  = ~You deal in grief every day, <CHARNAME>. How can you remember every person that needs your help? But Kamir's story... I can never put it out of my mind. He was a paladin we met at the graveyard in Athkatla, mourning his son's death.~
@872  = ~And?~
@873  = ~I do not wish to talk about it.~
@874  = ~O, yes! He was the paladin whom we talked into becoming a guardian for an orphaned girl, right? So why did you remind me of him?~
@875  = ~For many years a child of my own meant another person cursed. But now I think of someone to carry Corthala's name with pride. With honor. A man's life is incomplete without it, <CHARNAME>. Hollow.~
@876  = ~Valygar... must we talk about it now? We are too young to think of children.~
@877  = ~A person's life is hollow if it has no direction and aim, Valygar. Some find it in building family and others... others fight evil, travel or write histories. Children are not the only thing that brings fulfillment.~
@878  = ~I do not know, Valygar. I never felt a desire to birth a child. Perhaps, it is because my being is attuned to taking life, rather than giving it.~
@879  = ~Only if final means hollow for you.... Children are a mortal's bid to immortality, a little piece of self left on this Plane to atone for his mistakes after the soul has slipped away to the afterlife.~
@880  = ~I am glad that you have asked; I did not start this conversation, because I was afraid to hurt you. Having children, Valygar, is something a mature person needs to find her peace.~
@881  = ~And what do you think, Valygar?~
@882  = ~I remember Kamir's despair. He was stricken. I wagered that he wanted an arrow through his chest. Why, I thought, why anyone would want put himself through this? I got my answer, <CHARNAME>. He started to heal when an orphaned girl was given into his care. He needed fatherhood to become whole again. He wanted another chance.~
@883  = ~But there was hope in this tale, <CHARNAME>. Kamir adopted an orphaned girl; it was... beautiful.~
@884  = ~It was a noble deed...~
@885  = ~(Smile) Yes, I recall it now quite clearly. But why you remembered them to<DAYNIGHT>?~
@886  = ~Yes, beautiful, touchy and popular with sentimental old ladies. Now, if you are finished with the flashbacks, my hero -~
@887  = ~What - BLOODY - ever!~
@888  = ~I am not young any more, <CHARNAME>.~
@889  = ~Do you... do you want to have a child?~
@890  = ~Nonsense! You have more life in you than any other man in this company. *I* would know this. Now, cheer up and let us go.~
@891  = ~And what's that supposed to mean?~
@892  = ~Right. But holding a child of my own body in my arms is what I want. Seeing him grow. Teaching him the ways of the forest. I'm through with denying this to myself.~
@893  = ~I walk now, looking at you, and I think: what is the worst thing that could happen to me? I've lived in dishonor, and I have withstood pain. I died and I lived again... Your love, and me loving you are the things that were the best. They are the life.~
@894  = ~And I want it to come into being... ~
@895  = ~Do you realize that you are offering me the sorrow of seeing the death of my children in addition to the death of my lover? To mourn for centuries on end? No one should ask of a woman for such a thing!~
@896  = ~You are just as passionate now about wanting a child as you were before about not wanting it.~
@897  = ~I understand, Valygar, but I cannot give you an earnest answer. It would be madness to make such a plan under our present circumstances.~
@898  = ~You do not need all these fancy words, my love. Simply say that you want me to mother your children.~
@899  = ~I... I am sorry, I am dazed by your words. I will need to think about it.~
@900  = ~I can only say one thing, Valygar: I love you, but I do not want to have children.~
@901  = ~I have walked this road. It leads to a cliff over the emptiness.~
@902  = ~Yes; I have known it for years, but only meeting you made me understand it.~
@903  = ~It was not just noble... It was... his salvation.~
@904  = ~That I am not young any more and that often I look back and weigh my life.~
@905  = ~(Touches your shoulder) I cannot promise you not to die, my love. All men must; and elves, and dwarves... but I thought that our children and their children in turn would make my own demise less painful for you.~
@906  = ~It is madness perhaps... but I share your desire.~
@907  = ~I know and I do not expect you to tell me at once. But promise that you'll think about it, my love.~
@908  = ~Of course, I will.~
@909  = ~I thought of it before, and I always came to the conclusion that I do not want to have children. Not even yours. But it does not mean that I do not love you.~
@910  = ~What you have said rings true to me. I want to sit one day on the wooden steps of your cabin, squinting at the sun and looking into my child's eyes... deep, brown eyes... which I know so well.~
@911  = ~(Valygar embraces you gently and whispers into your ear) I want you to mother my children, <CHARNAME>.~
@912  = ~(Valygar embraces you gently) I love you.~
@913  = ~Then I'll stop talking, for now.~
@914  = ~When I was a child, before I understood anything about the Weave or arcane arts, I used to pretend I could do magic of my own-- like my mother, or my father could. I'd take a stick and poke the end in a fire, like this. (As he speaks, he does so, heating the end of a small branch in the flames until its tip glows a dull red.) I would wave it quickly, drawing shapes in the air. It's called fire-writing, I think. I have a mind to try it again. I want to spell <CHARNAME>.~
@915  = ~Valygar, don't! People see the fire of burning cities and the scarlet of spilt blood in my name already.~
@916  = ~Please do, I wish to see it.~
@917  = ~It will be so beautiful... ~
@918  = ~Are your hands agile enough to fire-write, Valygar?~
@919  = ~The fire which warms the wanderer in the middle of winter - that's what I see in your name. Passion, crimson flowers, sweet wine as well. Look into my eyes, <CHARNAME>, not into the eyes of the maddened crowd. What do you see?~
@920  = ~Fool! You know not what you are talking about. I am the flame of Nine Hells and the one who is meant to become the Lady of Murder. The passion you praise so, the passion I show in giving love is but a pale reflection of passion I show in giving death. How do you like my kisses now, Valygar? ~
@921  = ~I see my reflection in your eyes, beloved. That of a woman loved and in love. Write my name in the fiery letters if you wish, but put yours by it as well. For without you I will be a different <CHARNAME>.~
@922  = ~I see...myself. I am what I am in your eyes, Valygar.~
@923  = ~I do not see anything, Valygar. It's getting late and we shall go sleep. Together or apart - the choice is yours.~
@924  = ~Then look. (Valygar waves the smoldering stick, and the first letter of your name glimmers orange against the night sky. To your surprise, it does not fade. Neither does the second one.)~
@925  = ~Beautiful. (You wait until Valygar finishes your name. It hangs there in the air.) But it is incomplete, darling.~
@926  = ~(You nod contentedly.) Aye, very nice. Now let us go sleep. I am exhausted.~
@927  = ~I suppose magic indeed nests deep within you. But that's not necromancy.~
@928  = ~*The fire-writing holds no fascination for you.* It's getting late and we should go to sleep. Together or apart - the choice is yours.~
@929  = ~Try me. (Valygar grins and without a further word, begins to wave the smoldering stick; the first letter of your name glimmers orange against the night sky. To your surprise it does not fade. Neither does the second one.)~
@930  = ~*You nod contentedly.* Aye, very nice. Now let us go sleep. I am exhausted.~
@931  = ~On my lips, lady!~
@932  = ~Say what you will, but when I love you, you are ten times the flame than when you fight beside me.~
@933  = ~And yet I am the flame that devours.~
@934  = ~Then they will land on your lips, fool.  (You slide your fingers into Valygar's hair, drag his head to yours and give him an angry, predatory kiss.)~
@935  = ~(Anger wells up in you, but vanishes as suddenly as it came; you slump back and reply almost meekly.)  What... what were we talking about? Fire-writing? ~
@936  = ~(Valygar grins, and without further words, he waves the smoldering stick; the first letter of your name glimmers orange against the night sky. To your surprise it does not fade. Neither does the second one? He continues writing and in a few moments your name and his glitter in the night.)~
@937  = ~Quite inventive, my dear. Now, I am off to my bedroll. Are you coming or are you going to gawk at this all night long?~
@938  = ~I guess magic indeed nests deep within you. But that's not necromancy.~
@939  = ~Valygar and <CHARNAME>... <CHARNAME> and Valygar... that sounds so right, my love.~
@940  = ~Of course. (His eyes never leave yours)~
@941  = ~(As if drawn into the dark depth of your beloved's eyes, you lean toward him slowly until your lips touch.)~
@942  = ~(You cough and shake your head slightly) What... what were we talking about? Fire-writing?~
@943  = ~(You shake your head as if trying to get rid of a too persistent fly. The spell is broken) It's getting late and we should go to sleep. Together or apart - the choice is yours.~
@944  = ~Together. (Valygar gets up and throws the stick into the fire, then slips his arms around your waist.) Did you doubt it, lady?~
@945  = ~How so?~
@946  = ~(You take his hand in his, guiding it to add 'Corthala' after your name.) Just so.~
@947  = ~You should write yours by it. Then it should be... as it should be.~
@948  = ~Never mind. I am too tired to think straight. We should go to sleep now. Together or apart - the choice is yours.~
@949  = ~(He smiles at you.) No, it is not. With you around I forget about death magic.~
@950  = ~Tsk, tsk... I guess I am lousy inspiration then.~
@951  = ~With you I forget about death.~
@952  = ~No, no. You are moody; you are unkind to yourself. (Valygar cups your chin with his palm and lifts your face up. His lips descend on yours, parting them, his tongue tasting your mouth.)~
@953  = ~(You feel unsteady on your feet as your knees weaken. You cling to Valygar to keep upright)~
@954  = ~(You push Valygar away decisively) I am what I am. Get away from me while you can! Next time you might not escape with your life.~
@955  = ~It's getting late and I grow... tired. We should go to bed. Together or apart - the choice is yours.~
@956  = ~(You can feel Valygar's entire body tighten as he presses you against his chest, drinking thirstily of your kisses.)~
@957  = ~Yes. I was going to write your name. Like that.  (Valygar waves the smoldering stick; the first letter of your name glimmers orange against the night sky. To your surprise it does not fade. Neither does the second one.)~
@958  = ~(He grins) I'd much rather gawk at a naked woman than at her name. (Valygar gets up and throws the stick into the fire, then slips his arms around your waist.) Come, <CHARNAME>.~
@959  = ~As if they are fated to be together? ~
@960  = ~YES! In one bed. It's getting late and I grow... tired. I should go to bed. Together or apart - the choice is yours.~
@961  = ~Perhaps. Or maybe they just rhyme or something. Anyway, good night!~
@962  = ~(You smile.) And what do *you* think? After all, your mother came from the Land of Fate.~
@963  = ~(He whispers) You are temptation incarnate, you know that?~
@964  = ~(Valygar looks at the scarlet letters for a time and then slowly turns his eyes toward you. For a moment it looks like he is going to speak, but instead he pulls you down to sit on his lap, stroking your hair and your cheeks. He appears to be entranced by the gleaming <CHARNAME> Corthala.)~
@965  = ~(Valygar obeys; and in a few moment his name glitters against the night sky, side by side with yours.) ~
@966  = ~Quite inventive, my dear. Now, I am off to my bedroll. Are you coming or are you going to gawk at this all night long? ~
@967  = ~I guess magic indeed nests deep in your bones. But that's not necromancy.~
@968  = ~Valygar and <CHARNAME>... <CHARNAME> and Valygar. That sounds so right, my love.~
@969  = ~For a Necromancer - perhaps. But for me, you are the best kind of inspiration. The kind that makes me want to live.~
@970  = ~And so do I when I am with you.~
@971  = ~(Valygar lifts you of your feet and for a few moments he continues kissing you, while cradling you in his arms. Then he carries you away... The night sky is wide open above you)~
@972  = ~Then I might as well get as far away from you as I can.~
@973  = ~You know what I think... (Valygar buries his face in your hair)~
@974  = ~I think that you are temptation incarnate...~
@975  = ~Good night then, <CHARNAME>.~
@976  = ~(Your brave company is resting their feet for a moment. You notice a splash of color against Valygar's dark skin. A butterfly apparently chose the back of his hand as its sunbathing spot. It sits there now, its tender wings trembling, and Valygar watches it with an amused smile.)~
@977  = ~Shoo! Shoo! None flirts with my man!~
@978  = ~Ah, Valygar, this empty-headed creature seems to agree with me on one thing: you are the warmest man I met.~
@979  = ~It's beautiful! Where did you find it?~
@980  = ~Are you training to be a beast master, Valygar and starting small?~
@981  = ~(You say nothing, but you watch the beauty and the beast and smile.)~
@982  = ~(As the butterfly flies away in panic Valygar grins) Now I know what they mean when they say that love worms its way into your heart, yet jealousy has wings.~
@983  = ~I assure you that I knew well enough that my little girlfriend there did not love me. She used me and she abandoned me at the first sight of troubles... Women!~
@984  = ~(Valygar extends his wrist to you) Now, since the space is unoccupied do you want to take it? Or would you rather I'd do this? (Valygar laps you and kisses your forehead.) My butterfly.~
@985  = ~I was called many things in my life, but never that, my sweet <CHARNAME>. Perhaps, you are changing me.~
@986  = ~It found me, actually. Strangely, this seems to be the pattern in my life recently: the most beautiful and wonderful creatures come looking for me. <CHARNAME> of Candlekeep is one...~
@987  = ~I'll tell you if you kiss me, <CHARNAME>.~
@988  = ~Yes, of course! The smallest creatures can be dangerous foes. As soon as I master the communication with the fire ants I should deliver an army of a million fierce soldiers under your command.~
@989  = ~No, one has to be born into becoming a beast master, <CHARNAME>.~
@990  = ~(Valygar's gaze lifts up from the butterfly and meets yours. He smiles back at you.) It is a wonderful dream I was having. About a woman of beauty with flowers and butterflies in her hair. Her name was <CHARNAME>, and she was laughing.~
@991  = ~(Valygar blows softly on his airy companion and it flies toward you and lands at your nose) I was aiming this kiss for your lips, my beauty... That'' a lesson to me - never send someone else to do my job.  (Valygar leans over and his lips touch yours with more gentleness than butterfly's wings)~
@992  = ~<CHARNAME>, it is my job to scout around and... Right, right! You caught me idling. It's good to be back in the forest after dusty streets of Amkethran. Will you sit with me for a moment? (Valygar leans against a mighty oak's trunk and taps the grass by his side. It does look quite inviting)~
@993  = ~You walk over to the brooding ranger and kneel at his side. You reach forward and take a twig from Valygar's hair and put it in his palm.~
@994  = ~Is there a reason why you chose this particular tree, Valygar?~
@995  = ~(Sighs) I promise, we will have time for idle strolls in the woods soon, my love, but-~
@996  = ~You smile, close your eyes and listen to the silence of the sunlit woods.~
@997  = ~You smile, close your eyes and listen to the silence of the moonlit woods.~
@998  = ~Do you plan to laze around all day, ranger? ~
@999  = ~What is it? Aha, I knew that this chick was up to no good. (Laughs) Not that kind of a chick, my jealous... Here is the culprit. (Following Valygar's gaze you see that one of the branches hosts a collection of twigs - a bird's nest on closer inspection. A chick's head emerges from the nest and the tiny perfection of a baby bird chirps quite excitedly at Valygar and <CHARNAME>)~
@1000 = ~I was not a tiniest bit jealous! But good for you it was *that* kind of a chick.~
@1001 = ~(You watch a white feather to descend slowly through the air, mesmerized by its beauty.)~
@1002 = ~(Valygar takes you by your shoulders and moves in such way that you notice a collection of twigs on one of the branches - a bird's nest on closer inspection. A chick's head emerges from the nest and the tiny perfection of a baby bird chirps quite excitedly at Valygar and <CHARNAME>) ~
@1003 = ~(A feather drifts down from the nest as you watch and Valygar catches it in his hand.)~
@1004 = ~I hope that you reasoning is not as poor in other matters. Bird's nest...phew, big deal- ~
@1005 = ~(Sighs) I promise, we will have time for idle strolls in the woods soon, my love, but- ~
@1006 = ~Not another word- (Valygar's interrupted by the most bemused chirping. Apparently one of the branches hosts a collection of twigs - a bird's nest on closer inspection. A chick's head pops out of the mess, in an attempt to figure out what's going on under *his* tree)~
@1007 = ~A feather drifts down from the nest as you watch and Valygar catches it in his hand.~
@1008 = ~Great! Now we have done it! With my luck, his mommy is one of those griffons or giant eagles... and very irritable to boot.~
@1009 = ~(sighs) I promise, we will have time for idle strolls in the woods soon, my love, but-~
@1010 = ~(Something soft brushes your neck...too soft to be Valygar's fingers. But when you open your eyes, it's Valygar you see standing close to you) I am sorry, you two are quite a match - both lithe and ready to take flight. (You notice a feather in Valygar's hand...and happy chirping points to where it came from - among the branches there is a bird's nest, occupied by an excited chick)~
@1011 = ~It is beautiful... ~
@1012 = ~You blow on the feather softly, so it slips between Valygar's fingers and lands itself in the midst of his dark braids.~
@1013 = ~It tickles, you impossible, crazy, god-awful- ~
@1014 = ~Thinking...thinking of building your...your own nest, Valygar?~
@1015 = ~(Grins lazily and stretches) Now, that you have mentioned it... (The serious expression returns to his face momentarily however, he gets off the ground and after throwing one glance at the tree crown, he walks away.)~
@1016 = ~(Valygar lifts you up in the air) Just to make sure...see, it's only a birdie! (A small feather drifts off the nest and settles on your hair. Once Valygar puts you back on the solid ground he catches it into his hand.) I have something of yours, sky lark.~
@1017 = ~Put it in the same chest you have my heart in, dear.~
@1018 = ~Oh, it's beautiful... ~
@1019 = ~We should...return it to the rightful owner and be on our way!~
@1020 = ~(Valygar catches the feather) Is it yours, sky lark?~
@1021 = ~Yes, but you can have it, dear. You two create an amusing contrast...~
@1022 = ~Is it yours, sky lark? ~
@1023 = ~Yes, it is. See what one can get by the bird's nest? (Valygar catches a small feather drifting through the air). Is it yours, sky lark?~
@1024 = ~I hope so...Wait!  (Valygar catches a small feather that drifted down from the nest)~
@1025 = ~Is it yours, sky lark?~
@1026 = ~Then you two are quite a pair...~
@1027 = ~I never suspected that you have a liking for Cernd's style of...erm...headpiece. My love, I would kill a rabid wizard, a demon or a dragon at your bidding, but do not ask me to go around in feathers and cloak made of leaves... Besides they do not come in my size....~
@1028 = ~My love, I would kill a rabid wizard, a demon or a dragon at your bidding, but do not ask me to go around in feathers like some effete elf.... Besides we are clearly not a bird of a feather with that chick...size wise. If that was a griffon's feather or a giant eagle's, then maybe.~
@1029 = ~(Valygar swirls you around, leaving you breathless) What, just these three? You are running out of epithets, love. Let me help you out: bewitched, beloved, loyal, true...~
@1030 = ~I promise to shoo away any giant eagle...or griffon should it come calling...or any other creature who'd dare to ruffle your feathers...wait, did you lose one, sky lark? (Valygar opens his palm and you see a small feather)~
@1031 = ~(Kisses your ear) Don't...~
@1032 = ~I will. ~
@1033 = ~Ah, but the rightful owner *gave* it to us. I will keep it, <CHARNAME>. ~
@1034 = ~(Now it is as good time as any to show tender affection for your lover, Valygar.~
@1035 = ~This insane man is a god?! And my rival?~
@1036 = ~My lost innocence turned into a Slayer. How droll. I guess, my virginity is roaming around as a demon or dragon somewhere as well.~
@1037 = ~ My lost innocence turned into a Slayer. How droll. I guess, my virginity is roaming around as a demon or dragon somewhere as well.~
@1038 = ~That woman, the one I could have been had Gorion chosen differently, how did you feel about her? Do you think you could have... loved her?~
@1039 = ~You take advantage of the quiet to write in your journal: "The nights here, in Tethyr, are warm in <MONTH>. The air is alive with the sound of chirping insects and with the fragrance of the plants exhausted by the day's heat. The nights in Tethyr in <MONTH> are a the perfect backdrop for tales of seduction and unabated passions..." You stop writing and lift your head up from the journal.~
@1040 = ~(You catch Valygar looking at you and stick your tongue at him.)~
@1041 = ~(You come up to Valygar from behind, embrace him and rest your chin on his shoulder) This place, it's awful, but it is also strangely liberating. It belongs to me... the first place ever that belongs to me. Why won't we take advantage of it, Valygar? (You press yourself against Valygar's back)~
@1042 = ~You profess your love for me often enough, ranger. What would you do out of love for me?~
@1043 = ~ Why do you like kissing me so? Am I sweet?~
@1044 = ~Come here, my dear.~
@1045 = ~(You look at Valygar and then close your eyes.)~
@1046 = ~Tell me why you love me, Valygar?~
@1047 = ~(You think of Valygar and suddenly your heart fills to bursting. (Softly, you say his name:) "Valygar"...~
@1048 = ~(It is almost time for a rest.  You have decided to grant Valygar his wish to spend the night with you.)~
@1049 = ~(It is almost time for a rest.  Valygar's wish to spend the night with you is tempting. Maybe... you should just tell him so?)~
@1050 = ~(It is almost time for a rest. If you want Valygar can be yours tonight.)~
@1051 = ~Valygar, this world is so unstable. All things change. Like my heart. We... Let us remain friends.~
@1052 = ~(Leave Valygar alone for now.)~
@1053 = ~But one thing stays the same: Valygar Corthala is forever a fool. Keep your heart to yourself, lady.~
@1054 = ~(Valygar's hand touches your shoulder) What are you writing, <CHARNAME>?~
@1055 = ~(wink) An account of my conquests, Valygar.~
@1056 = ~I am trying to describe a Tethyrian night.~
@1057 = ~It is nothing, my heart. Nothing.~
@1058 = ~Let me see?~
@1059 = ~(You extend the notes to Valygar)~
@1060 = ~(You press your notes against your chest)~
@1061 = ~(You start reading, trying to keep your voice throaty and tempting. It starts trembling when you reach the last sentence) "The nights in Tethyr in <MONTH> are a the perfect backdrop for the tales of seduction and unabated passions..."~
@1062 = ~(He reads and looks up at you. The light of the torches makes his eyes look like liquid jet. It is quite clear that he wants more than words of passion.) ~
@1063 = ~Yes...~
@1064 = ~"The nights here, in Tethyr, are warm in <MONTH>. The air is alive with the sound of chirping insects and with the fragrance of the plants exhausted by the day's heat. The nights in Tethyr in <MONTH> are a the perfect backdrop for the tales of seduction and unabated passions..."

"Tonight is one such night. I am in love with a man so completely, so utterly, so unconditionally... tonight my desire for him was augmented by the caress of the warm wind, by the shy twinkle of the large southern stars, by the oneness of the velvet skies."

"And I was longed for in a similar fashion. Tonight was a night without bounds, binds and bonds. My mouth is still dry; my eyes can barely see the light of the dawn; my body is still hot from the urgency and wildness that it tasted.~
@1065 = ~Not now!~
@1066 = ~(He nuzzles your neck) So, should I tell you one such tale?~
@1067 = ~ Words won't be enough, my lover.~
@1068 = ~That is where I wish to be right now.~
@1069 = ~(Smile) As they say - keep it secret and keep it safe.~
@1070 = ~(Hoarsely) It's a great beginning for a tale. (Nuzzles your neck) Can we... can we continue with it?~
@1071 = ~Yes, we can... but the words won't be enough, my lover.~
@1072 = ~Some people place their faith in him, love.~
@1073 = ~I will crush him to goo next time he dares to cross my path!~
@1074 = ~I think... I think I am beginning to understand why you do not worship any deity.~
@1075 = ~And take his place? Do you truly want to live here for all eternity? To fight this war for eternity?~
@1076 = ~But why? He is mad enough to want to be a Lord of Murder... why not leave it to him?~
@1077 = ~Because of Cyric? No... It's because I much prefer demi-gods to gods. In particular, a lady called <CHARNAME>.~
@1078 = ~Oh, but I do worship as of late... Only she is not a goddess yet, and I hope that she'd never become one.~
@1079 = ~(Crooked smile) May the gods have mercy on me.~
@1080 = ~Yes, I did not know that my gift to you could become so... tangible. ~
@1081 = ~I will once I have become one.~
@1082 = ~(Kiss Valygar.) Dark times, dark moods.~
@1083 = ~It won't. I keep this flower safe in my heart.~
@1084 = ~You will always have your innocence my love, no matter what we see in this twisted place.~
@1085 = ~(Valygar takes your hands in his.) That woman was not you. She was no more than a ghost to scare you.~
@1086 = ~You might as well ask me if I would have recognized you at a masquerade. No mask would have hidden what you truly are from me.~
@1087 = ~You loved me when I was a bitter fugitive wrapped in my own fears and hatreds. You helped me to become myself again. I hope I could have done the same for you.~
@1088 = ~(Valygar leans forward so that you end up dangling in the air.) Well, let us go find the corner where the insipid imp won't show up in an inopportune moment under the pretext of spring-cleaning.~
@1089 = ~This place... this place turns my mind off love, <CHARNAME>.~
@1090 = ~Can you imagine loving me on a large black rock in the middle of a molten lava stream? I think I saw one of the right size around the corner.~
@1091 = ~O, I see...~
@1092 = ~We will end up fried like a pair of capons!~
@1093 = ~Lead on, you crazy woman.~
@1094 = ~With you, my love, who needs bubbling lava, but if you insist.~
@1095 = ~Anything.~
@1096 = ~Anything? Does that mean that you'd kill an innocent for me?~
@1097 = ~Will you die for me?~
@1098 = ~ Will you steal for me?~
@1099 = ~Will you lie for me?~
@1100 = ~I... I just wanted to tell you that I would never ask you to do anything that goes against your honor.~
@1101 = ~(Thoughtfully) I kill for you every day, <CHARNAME>, and some of those we vanquish are only guilty of opposing you.~
@1102 = ~I hope that the woman I love would never ask such a thing of me.~
@1103 = ~I said anything, and it was not an idle word. But I will not do it unless the need is dire and I have to protect you.~
@1104 = ~Yes, I will.~
@1105 = ~If I can buy your life with mine, I am willing to pay the price.~
@1106 = ~If I have to, but I cannot promise you that I won't get caught. I am not a thief.~
@1107 = ~Yes, but I will not lie to you.~
@1108 = ~I'll do what's needed.~
@1109 = ~I hope you do not expect me to spin too complex a tale. For that you need a bard.~
@1110 = ~(Kisses your brow) I chose your honor over mine, <CHARNAME>.~
@1111 = ~Sweeter than Tethyrian wines of the Year of Plenty.~
@1112 = ~(Laugh) And my lips are just as red, o the most pathetic of the bards?~
@1113 = ~Then you should be cautious not to overindulge.~
@1114 = ~This epithet won't be a consequence of Bodhi turning you into a vampire? ~
@1115 = ~Not just your lips, my love (cups your breast with his palm)~
@1116 = ~Do I look like a cautious man to you? (Kisses your neck under your ear)~
@1117 = ~Then I will have a smallest sip right now... (Kisses your little finger)~
@1118 = ~Let me overindulge myself for once, my love, just so I know the danger of it.~
@1119 = ~I will not lie; I wanted to drink your blood, then. But now that you have brought me back to life, it is not my teeth that I wish to sink into your flesh.~
@1120 = ~No, this epithet comes from the experiences of a man made out of flesh and blood, not from a slab of dead meat with blood-hunger.~
@1121 = ~A vampire did not love you, <CHARNAME>, but the man's memory in him did.~
@1122 = ~Is it a complaint?~
@1123 = ~Yes. My lips are all chapped by the dry winds of the Nine Hells as is!~
@1124 = ~(Hug Valygar) Yeeees.... In fact I was going to write a complaint to the Chief Inspector Brega.~
@1125 = ~Not mine, but Cespanar got jealous.~
@1126 = ~Then I do not kiss you enough. Every ranger who lived in the wilds knows that only by moistening your lips enough can you prevent them from cracking. It generally gets worse before it gets better but one should be very persistent if she ever wants her lips healed.~
@1127 = ~Then I should take over his position!~
@1128 = ~The imp can die of jealousy as far as I am concerned.~
@1129 = ~Why you keep that imp is beyond me.~
@1130 = ~He has seen nothing yet!~
@1131 = ~Am I too far away, <CHARNAME>?~
@1132 = ~If you are not in my arms, you are too far.~
@1133 = ~Far enough that I do not hear your heart beat.~
@1134 = ~No, but I want you... closer.~
@1135 = ~(Valygar embraces you) Is that better?~
@1136 = ~(Valygar takes your hand in his and places your palm over his heart.)~
@1137 = ~And so do I.~
@1138 = ~(Grins) No.~
@1139 = ~Then suffer my inattention. (Lift your nose up in the air.)~
@1140 = ~(Coldly) As you wish.~
@1141 = ~Then, I'll have to come to you... if you will have me.~
@1142 = ~(Valygar walks over to you and pinches your nose slightly)~
@1143 = ~(Valygar engulfs you in a bear hug.) Miss Snowmaiden.~
@1144 = ~(Valygar opens his arms ready to catch you)~
@1145 = ~And my reward will be?~
@1146 = ~Is not being near me a reward in itself, Valygar?~
@1147 = ~Let me see... (you rummage through your pack) A dried apple core? ~
@1148 = ~Ear-pulling for wandering away from my sight! ~
@1149 = ~Indeed, it is.~
@1150 = ~(Laughs) Well, the way we eat on the march it's worth considering. ~
@1151 = ~Er... would I have to eat it? Or can I just... have it?~
@1152 = ~Looks good. But not good enough to eat, unlike you. (Valygar growls and jokingly 'ravages' your neck)~
@1153 = ~I am sorry ma'am, but stealthiness was one reason why you initially-~
@1154 = ~(Burst out laughing) Forgiven!~
@1155 = ~(Growl) Do not provoke me or you may find a Slayer upon you! ~
@1156 = ~ Of course. But try to be stealthy for everyone else but me.~
@1157 = ~Thank you, O merciful one.~
@1158 = ~ I'd rather you didn't take that foul transformation so lightly, <CHARNAME>.~
@1159 = ~(Scratches his head) I would if I could.~
@1160 = ~(Someone blows at your eyelashes. You suspect that it is Valygar.)~
@1161 = ~(You open your eyes to confirm your guess.)~
@1162 = ~(Blindly, you incline your head forward, chasing the warm breath.)~
@1163 = ~(Valygar's face is as close to yours as you have only seen it in the most intimate moments when you shared a kiss or loved each other. Valygar's eyes darken, and you know that he is remembering the jolts of passion that went through you on these occasions...)~
@1164 = ~(Valygar's lips touch to your forehead.)~
@1165 = ~(Valygar's cheek, scratchy with a day's stubble presses against your skin.)~
@1166 = ~(Valygar gently kisses the top of your head.)~
@1167 = ~Are you daydreaming, love?~
@1168 = ~No, dear. I am just tired.~
@1169 = ~About me?~
@1170 = ~Of course not! I am dreaming about *another* tall and grim ranger.~
@1171 = ~ Why would I daydream about *you*? I have you already.~
@1172 = ~(Smile) Yes...~
@1173 = ~ I see. I'll let him know that he is a luckiest man alive.~
@1174 = ~I hope that it is because you love me <CHARNAME>.~
@1175 = ~I am flattered.~
@1176 = ~Then we should stop and rest.~
@1177 = ~Did not like what you saw, <CHARNAME>? ~
@1178 = ~I did so!~
@1179 = ~Well, if you have your hair washed, and let Cespenar to polish -~
@1180 = ~Very much so, love. ~
@1181 = ~(Grins) Ouf, then I worried needlessly.~
@1182 = ~This imp is *not* touching my armor! Or my hair! You on another hand -~
@1183 = ~I wish you knew what pleasure it gives me to see you every day.~
@1184 = ~I know.~
@1185 = ~Tell me.~
@1186 = ~It's like... If winter lasted four hundred years, cold and hungry and then the sun came out and you knew it was spring and it was warm. I am sorry, <CHARNAME>, I am doing my best to explain the feeling but I am not a bard.~
@1187 = ~(Valygar smiles and shakes his head.)~
@1188 = ~(Slowly pull your tongue back, leaving your lips parted and moist from its touch.)~
@1189 = ~(Pull your tongue back and pout)~
@1190 = ~(Lick your lips suggestively and smile back.)~
@1191 = ~(Valygar accepts your invitation and plants a hard kiss on your lips.)~
@1192 = ~ You sulk prettily, my love, but your smile is even more beautiful.~
@1193 = ~(Breathes in deeply and nods his agreement) Yes, it would be good.~
@1194 = ~Simple enough. To know <CHARNAME> is to love <CHARNAME>. ~
@1195 = ~Because you never doubted that I did, even when I wouldn't admit it.~
@1196 = ~(Grins) You know why. You are so smart and so eloquent that you do not need to be beautiful to charm. Your beauty is so bright that a man would not care if you had brains at all.~
@1197 = ~I wonder if you could answer a similar question. Why do you love me, <CHARNAME>?~
@1198 = ~Your subtle charm, of course!~
@1199 = ~I have no idea!~
@1200 = ~I love you because you are strong and have a good heart. Because your shoulders are wide and your glance is deep. I love you because if I were seated in a circle of the most beautiful women your eyes would rest only on me. I love you because - ~
@1201 = ~(Laughs) I have been called many things, but "subtle"...~
@1202 = ~See, it's the most difficult question of all.~
@1203 = ~...because you love me. And that is the simplest and the truest answer. ~
@1204 = ~(The ranger turns around and breathes): "<CHARNAME> ". (You can hear the same longing in his voice as you just felt.)~
@1205 = ~(Valygar raises his brow at you.)~
@1206 = ~(You laugh and kiss his brow)~
@1207 = ~(They say that the name of your lover is the sweetest thing. I wanted a taste of it. ~
@1208 = ~V - for valiant, A - for ardent, L - for love, Y - for...~
@1209 = ~Yelling? Yielding?~
@1210 = ~...to temptation... ~
@1211 = ~Nope. Y is for "my yearning for you"~
@1212 = ~Aha! Got it! Y stands for YES! ~
@1213 = ~Y - is for you, G is for great, A is for awesome and R - for romantic... ~
@1214 = ~(Smiles) I wish I could match you, but all I can think of is that <CHARNAME> stands for "my joy".~
@1215 = ~(You notice that Valygar sits apart from the rest of your companions, looking off into the distance, apparently lost in thought.  You approach him quietly.  He smiles as you approach.)  Good evening, <CHARNAME>.~
@1216 = ~Valygar, may I speak to you for a moment?  Alone?~
@1217 = ~(Valygar turns towards you, a strange look in his eyes.)  Certainly, <CHARNAME>.  (He takes your hand and you walk away from your companions.)  What's on your mind, my lady?~
@1218 = ~If you will still have me, sweet, I would like to spend the night with you.~
@1219 = ~It's nothing.~
@1220 = ~(You notice that Valygar is not among the other companions. Finally, you spot him sitting aside, watching something in the distance.  You approach him, stepping as softly as you can and, for a moment, consider closing his eyes with your palms.  You then fold your hands back and start to walk away.)~
@1221 = ~(Valygar turns around quickly, catches you in his arms and sits you on his lap.)  Do not run away, <CHARNAME>, please.  What is on your mind?~
@1222 = ~I...I will not run Valygar.  Not anymore.  I am tired of saying "no".  If you still desire me... the whole of me... then I will not reject you, my beloved.~
@1223 = ~(You notice that Valygar sits apart from the rest of your companions, looking off into the distance, apparently lost in thought. You approach him quietly. He smiles as you approach.)  Good evening, <CHARNAME>.~
@1224 = ~(You run a finger up and down his arm.)  It's awfully cold tonight, Valygar.  It might be beneficial if we were to...share our blankets, and our body heat.  (You smile seductively at him and wrap your arms around him.)  Besides, my dearest love, I want to be with you.~
@1225 = ~(Valygar takes your face in his hands and kisses you gently.)  <CHARNAME>, are you sure about this?  I do not want to pressure you into anything.~
@1226 = ~I have never been more certain.~
@1227 = ~I am sure, Valygar.~
@1228 = ~Maybe another time.~
@1229 = ~(Valygar kisses you a bit more passionately.)  I have waited for this for quite a while, my darling.  I want nothing more than to love you.~
