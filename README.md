## About
Originally a part of the TeamBG mod 'Tortured Souls', the romance had a short-lived history as stand-alone part of said mod. When support for the stand-alone Valygar romance was abandoned, Beyshaliban volunteered to make it a WeiDU mod.  

The original path and speed of the romance was altered and Domi wrote a lot of additional lovetalks, flirts and banters.  

ToB content was added and the mod reached beta status in 2005. The SoA part was still under revision then. Aside from that, an expansion to the Sphere Quest was added.  You will meet an interesting not joinable NPC, a character from Valygar's past, based on Domi's story Biographer's Notes: Valygar. ( http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=1628 )

In 2018, the mod was fully recoded and revised by jastey, with Domi's blessings.



## Content
The Mod Corthala Romantique adds a romance for female PCs (no short races) of good or neutral alignment (no chaotic neutral) or female druids. To proceed with the romance, the reputation has to be above 13.

The mod also adds friendship talks for the SoA part of the game for PCs that do not fulfill the romance criteria. For ToB, all dialogues added are for romance, only.

Also added are banters with other NPCs and interjections, for romance and non-romance case.

As a second, optional component, the "bathing flirt" can be installed for the romance -  there was a time back then where NPCs were supposed to have at least one, romantic-encounter-like bathing flirt, "Kelsey-style". Although being a very romantic and humorous encounter, it was made an own install option because reply options and PC reactions are not always freely chosable. The content does not exceed teen rating. 

The third, independently installable component introduces a quest to let the sphere be guarded or be sealed forever by a friend of Valygar, Leonora. The quest can be installed and played without the romance.
The quest to close the sphere might trigger while the sphere quests are still running. Just tell Valygar that it has to wait.

Disclaimer:  
The romance focuses on emotions rather than actions.  However, there are actions, directly and implied.  Nothing that goes further than what is already in the game.  Still, keep in mind that Baldur's Gate II was rated TEEN when first released.
